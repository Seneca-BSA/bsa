Referring to Yiu or the Cortex-M4 Technical Reference, what is the instruction for storing data from a register in memory? Procedures Firmware Update If you are using the Freedom-K64F, you might need to update its firmware before using it with Windows 10. Even if you are not using Windows 10, updating the firmware might be a good idea. Unplug the Freedom board then hold down the \"RESET SW1\" button as you plug the board into your computer to enter bootloader mode. Figure 1.1 Start in Bootloader Mode Once plugged in, if you see anything else but \"MAINTENANCE\" (such as seeing \"BOOTLOADER\"), then we need to update the firmware. Follow only step 1-10 on the Getting Started with the FRDM-K64F BUT USE THE FILES BELOW. For K64F: here are the files: 0244_k20dx_bootloader_update_0x5000.bin for updating the OpenSDA bootloader (Reference: DAPLink bootloader update ) k20dx_frdmk64f_if_crc_legacy_0x5000 for loading the CMSIS-DAP application back onto the board (Reference: OpenSDA Serial and Debug Adapter ) For K66F: here are the files: 0244_k20dx_bootloader_update_0x8000.bin for updating the OpenSDA bootloader (Reference: DAPLink bootloader update ) k20dx_frdmk66f_if_crc for loading the CMSIS-DAP application back onto the board (Reference: OpenSDA Serial and Debug Adapter ) If the bootloader drive is not showing, try updating the bootloader using non-Windows 10 computer. If it is still not showing up, the board might be in a bricked state. In this case, an external device must be used to flash a new bootloader. Follow the instruction here . Install IDE Install the MCUXpresso IDE from NXP (account creation required) or using Seneca MyApps . NOTE: If the board is not recognized by Windows, download latest driver for Windows.

The partitioning is based on typical usages so that different areas are designed to be used primarily for: Program code accesses (e.g., CODE region) Data accesses (e.g., SRAM region) Peripherals (e.g., Peripheral region) Processor\u2019s internal control and debug components (e.g., Private Peripheral Bus) The architecture also allows high flexibility to allow memory regions to be used for other purposes. For example, programs can be executed from the CODE as well as the SRAM region, and a microcontroller can also integrate SRAM blocks in CODE region. Figure 2.1 Memory map In practice, many microcontroller devices only use a small portion of each region for program flash, SRAM, and peripherals. Some of the regions can be unused. Different microcontrollers have different memory sizes and peripheral address locations. This information is usually outlined in user manuals or datasheets from microcontroller vendors. Cortex-M4 Registers The register bank in the Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors has 16 registers. Thirteen of them are general-purpose 32-bit registers, and the other three have special uses, as can be seen in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2 Registers in the register bank R0 \u2013 R12 Registers R0 to R12 are general-purpose registers. The first eight (R0 \u2013 R7) are also called low registers. Due to the limited available space in the instruction set, many 16-bit instructions can only access the low registers. The high registers (R8 \u2013 R12) can be used with 32-bit instructions, and a few with 16-bit instructions, like MOV (move). The initial values of R0 to R12 are undefined. R13, stack pointer (SP) R13 is the Stack Pointer. It is used for accessing the stack memory via PUSH and POP operations. R14, link register (LR) R14 is also called the Link Register (LR). This is used for holding the return address when calling a function or subroutine. At the end of the function or subroutine, the program control can return to the calling program and resume by loading the value of LR into the Program Counter (PC). When a function or subroutine call is made, the value of LR is updated automatically. If a function needs to call another function or subroutine, it needs to save the value of LR in the stack first. Otherwise, the current value in LR will be lost when the function call is made. R15, program counter (PC) R15 is the Program Counter (PC). It is readable and writeable: a read returns the current instruction address plus 4 (this is due to the pipeline nature of the design, and compatibility requirement with the ARM7TDMI\u2122 processor). Writing to PC (e.g., using data transfer/processing instructions) causes a branch operation. Program status registers The Program Status Register is composed of three status registers: Application PSR (APSR) Execution PSR (EPSR) Interrupt PSR (IPSR) These three registers can be accessed as one combined register, referred to as xPSR in some documentation. In ARM\u00ae assembler, when accessing xPSR (Figure 2.3), the symbol PSR is used. Figure 2.3 Combined xPSR The main 4 status bits of interest are: N : Negative flag Z : Zero flag C : Carry (or NOT borrow) flag V : Overflow flag Reference: Yiu, Ch 4 Assembly Instruction Documentation of the Cortex-M4 instruction set can be found here: Arm Cortex-M4 Processor Technical Reference Manual Revision ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual Preparation Lab Preparation Question Answer the following questions on Blackboard once the pre-load quiz becomes available 24 hours before the lab session. Referring to the Cortex-M4 technical manual, how many \"Add\" instructions are there and what are they? Write the instruction that loads the address 0x20000010 into register R0. What is the difference between mov, movw, and movt? Refer to the Cortex-M4 manual, define the following four flags of the Program Status Register and how they will be triggered. N: Negative flag Z: Zero flag C: Carry (or NOT borrow) flag V: Overflow flag Procedures Open MCUXpresso then start a new C/C++ project based on the Freedom board model that you have. Figure 2.3 New Project In the new project configuration, rename the project then leave all other settings as default. Even though we will be programming in assembly language, we'll still like the IDE to use the SDK template to set up the Freedom board so we don't have to bother with the startup configuration (ie. vector table, ISR, stack address, heap address, etc.) Figure 2.4 New Project Name and Settings Once the project is created, rename the C-code file from \".c\" to \".s\". If the IDE is not allowing you to rename, delete the C-code file and create a new file of the same name but with the extension \".s\". Figure 2.5 Rename File Replace the code within the file with the following: .syntax unified @ unified syntax used .cpu cortex-m4 @ cpu is cortex-m4 .thumb @ use thumb encoding .global main @ declare main as a global variable .type main, %function @ set main to function type main: @ start of main code with an label ldr r0, =0x20000000 @ load 0x20000000 to R0 mov r1, #8 @ move #8 to R1 add r1, r1, #4 @ add #4 to R1 and write to R1 str r1, [r0] @ store value of R1 to address of R0 stop: @ define a new label called stop nop @ do nothing b stop @ jump back label stop to form a loop Your code should now look like this. Figure 2.6 Assembly Code Build and run the code using the debug option. Open both the register view and the memory view to address 0x20000000. Figure 2.7 Register and Memory View Step through the code and pay attention to the changes in the registers and memory. Step until you reach the stop label. Your code should not go any further as it will loop between the nop and b instructions. You can also see the program counter jumping back and forward. Answer question 1 of the post-lab. Next, re-run the code but this time, expand the program status register and notice the flags that change especially after an arithmetics instruction. Figure 2.8 Program Status Register Flags Now, to test your skills, write an assembly code that performs Exercise #2 from the module 3 lecture: Perform the calculation: A + B \u2013 C = D. Use 0x20000010 for variable A = first 2 digits of your student # Use 0x20000014 for variable B = next 2 digits of your student # Use 0x20000018 for variable C = next 2 digits of your student # Use 0x2000001C for variable D = 0 Is your answer correct? Copy your code into the post-lab assignment on Blackboard. Complete Question 3 of the post-lab. Post-Lab Questions Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the following post-lab question(s) on Blackboard. Due one week after the lab. In step 6 of the first program example, what value got saved to which address at the end of the str instruction? Paste your assembly code in step 8 here.

Post-Lab Questions Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the following post-lab question(s) on Blackboard. Due one week after the lab. Execute the code from step 4 then record the PSR flags. Copy and paste your code with PSR flags into Blackboard. Execute the code from step 6 then record the PSR flags. Copy and paste your code with PSR flags into Blackboard. Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius depending on the input. If the input is above 32, it will assume the value is Fahrenheit and convert it to Celsius. If not, it will assume the value is Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit. The input will go into R0 and it will be the last two digits of your student number. Do NOT modify R0 afterward. Your code must be written in assembly with the output saved in a variable (labelled space in memory). You can use the following as your conversion equation. C = 5 * (F - 32) / 9 F = (9 * C / 5) + 32 For the code above, at the end of execution, take a screenshot of your register bank, and your memory space showing the variable then copy your code into Blackboard.

In the previous lab, we also explored the idea of using a label to reference address in memory used in the same manner as variables in high-level programming language, this time, we'll explore the use of string. Replace the code within the file with the following: .syntax unified @ unified syntax used .cpu cortex-m4 @ cpu is cortex-m4 .thumb @ use thumb encoding .data @ put data in the data section myString: .string \"Hello world!\" @ declare a label for a string with a null terminator .text .global main @ declare main as a global variable .type main, %function @ set main to function type main: ldr r0, =myString @ Load the address of myString into R0 @ R0 = ? mov r1, #0 @ Initialize the counter @ R1 = ? loopCount: ldrb r2, [r0] @ Load the character from the address in R0 cmp r2, #0 @ check for null terminator @ R2 = ?

At the end of the program @ What is the length of the string? b loopCount countDone: stop: @ define a new label called stop nop @ do nothing b stop @ jump back label stop to form a loop Execute the code above, pay attention to what is happening in each register and record their value as per the code comment. Afterward, take a look at the memory address where the string is saved then take a screenshot showing the memory address along with the value and ASCII character saved in it. Submit your code and screenshot it as part of the post-lab. In the previous code, we explored the idea of using string. In this code, we'll take a look at the use of an array.

Afterward, take a look at the memory address where the array is saved then take a screenshot showing the memory address along with the value and highlight the negative. Submit your code and screenshot it as part of the post-lab. Lastly, the code from the first example can also be written as follows using an array instead of a string. Also, a different comparison statement is used. .syntax unified @ unified syntax used .cpu cortex-m4 @ cpu is cortex-m4 .thumb @ use thumb encoding .data @ put data in the data section myString: .ascii \"Hello world!\\0\" @ declare a label for a string with a null terminator .text .global main @ declare main as a global variable .type main, %function @ set main to function type main: ldr r0, =myString @ Load the address of myString into R0 mov r1, #0 @ Initialize the counter loopCount: ldrb r2, [r0], #1 @ Load the character from the address in R0 @ and update the pointer R0 cbz r2, countDone @ check for null terminator in one line @ If it is zero...null terminated... @ We are done with the string. @ The length is in R1. add r1, #1 @ increment the counter for length b loopCount countDone: stop: @ define a new label called stop nop @ do nothing b stop @ jump back label stop to form a loop Compare the third example code with the first example code and find the difference between then explain which line got added, removed, changed and why. Also, discuss its effect on the code then put your answer in the post-lab exercise.

This is the default when no suffix is specified. IT (If-Then) Block The IT (If-Then) block is a feature with ARM processor that validates the conditions specified in the IT instructions against the conditions specified in the following instructions. In anorder word, an IT help ensure there are no semantic error during assembly programming. An IT block have the following syntax: IT{x{y{z}}} {cond} where: x - specifies the condition switch for the second instruction in the IT block. y - specifies the condition switch for the third instruction in the IT block. z - specifies the condition switch for the fourth instruction in the IT block. cond - specifies the condition for the first instruction in the IT block. The condition switch for the second, third and fourth instruction in the IT block can be either: T - Then. Applies the condition to the instruction.cond E - Else. Applies the inverse condition of to the instruction.cond Example: itte ne @ define the two condition switches in IT block andne r0,r0,r1 @ first line in IT block, always an if addsne r2,r2,#1 @ second line in IT block, then moveq r2,r3 @ third line in IT block, else add r0,r0,r1 @ not in IT block itt eq @ define the one condition switches in IT block moveq r0,r1 @ first line in IT block, always an if beq main @ branch at end of IT block is permitted Register Use in the ARM Procudure Call Standard So far, we've been using the general purpose registers freely without much condition of what there are ideal for or any standards. However, below is a common convention to consider when using registers: Purpose Register Argument 1 r0 Argument 2 r1 Argument 3 r2 Argument 4 r3 Variable 1 r4 Variable 2 r5 Variable 3 r6 Variable 4 r7 Variable 5 r8 Variable 6 / Stack Base r9 Variable 7 / Stack Limit r10 Variable 8 / Frame Pointer r11 Intra-Procedure Scratch r12 Stack Pointer (SP) r13 Link Register (LR) r14 Program Counter (PC) r15 Note that even though SP, LR and PC are special register used by the processor, they can still be modified with code and used the same way as other registers. Introduction to Stack The stack is a data structure, known as last in first out (LIFO). In a stack, items entered at one end and leave in the reversed order. Stacks in microprocessors are implemented by using a stack pointer to point to the top of the stack in memory. As items are added to the stack (pushed), the stack pointer is moving up, and as items are removed from the stack (pulled or popped), the stack pointer is moved down. ARM stacks are very flexible since the implementation is completely left to the software. Stack pointer is a register that points to the top of the stack. In the ARM processor, any one of the general purpose registers could be used as a stack pointer. Since it is left to the software to implement a stack, different implemenation choices result different types of stacks. Normally, there are two types of the stacks depending on which way the stack grows. Ascending Stack - When items are pushed on to the stack, the stack pointer is increasing. That means the stack grows towards higher address. Descending Stack - When items are pushed on to the stack, the stack pointer is decreasing. That means the stack is growing towards lower address. Depending on what the stack pointer points to we can categorize the stacks into the following two types: Empty Stack - Stack pointer points to the location in which the next/first item will be stored. e.g. A push will store the value, and increment the stack pointer for an Ascending Stack. Full Stack - Stack pointer points to the location in which the last item was stored. e.g. A pop will decrement the stack pointer and pull the value for an Ascending Stack. So now we can have four possible types of stacks. They are: full-ascending stack, full-descending stack, empty-ascending stack, empty-descending stack. They can be implemented by using the register load and store instructions. Here are some instructions used to deal with stack: PUSH {R3} @ Push R3 onto the stack PUSH {R0, R4-R7} @ Push R0, R4, R5, R6, R7 onto the stack PUSH {R2, LR} @ Push R2 and the link register onto the stack POP {R0, R5, PC} @ pop and return from subroutine, branch to PC POP {R3} @ Pop stack value and save to R3 Push registers onto and pop registers off a full-descending stack. Subroutine and Stack A subroutine call can be implemented by pushing the return address on the stack and then jumping to the branch target address. When the subroutine is done, remember to pop out the saved information so that it will be able to return to the next instruction immediately after the calling point. Preparation Lab Preparation Question Read over the lab and write a pseudocode for the post-lab exercise 4. It should just be a small modification from the one your did in the previous lab. Submission on Blackboard is not required. Procedures Similar to the previous lab. Open MCUXpresso then start a new C/C++ project based on the Freedom board model that you have. In the new project configuration, rename the project then leave all other settings as default. Once the project is created, rename the C-code file from \".c\" to \".s\". If the IDE is not allowing you to rename, delete the C-code file and create a new file of the same name but with the extension \".s\". In this example, let's take a look as a simple subroutine call.

In a stack, items entered at one end and leave in the reversed order. Stacks in microprocessors are implemented by using a stack pointer to point to the top of the stack in memory. As items are added to the stack (pushed), the stack pointer is moving up, and as items are removed from the stack (pulled or popped), the stack pointer is moved down. ARM stacks are very flexible since the implementation is completely left to the software. Stack pointer is a register that points to the top of the stack. In the ARM processor, any one of the general purpose registers could be used as a stack pointer. Since it is left to the software to implement a stack, different implemenation choices result different types of stacks. Normally, there are two types of the stacks depending on which way the stack grows. Ascending Stack - When items are pushed on to the stack, the stack pointer is increasing. That means the stack grows towards higher address. Descending Stack - When items are pushed on to the stack, the stack pointer is decreasing. That means the stack is growing towards lower address. Depending on what the stack pointer points to we can categorize the stacks into the following two types: Empty Stack - Stack pointer points to the location in which the next/first item will be stored. e.g. A push will store the value, and increment the stack pointer for an Ascending Stack. Full Stack - Stack pointer points to the location in which the last item was stored. e.g. A pop will decrement the stack pointer and pull the value for an Ascending Stack. So now we can have four possible types of stacks. They are: full-ascending stack, full-descending stack, empty-ascending stack, empty-descending stack. They can be implemented by using the register load and store instructions. Here are some instructions used to deal with stack: PUSH {R3} @ Push R3 onto the stack PUSH {R0, R4-R7} @ Push R0, R4, R5, R6, R7 onto the stack PUSH {R2, LR} @ Push R2 and the link register onto the stack POP {R0, R5, PC} @ pop and return from subroutine, branch to PC POP {R3} @ Pop stack value and save to R3 Push registers onto and pop registers off a full-descending stack.","title":"Introduction to Stack"},{"location":"seh500/lab5/#subroutine-and-stack","text":"A subroutine call can be implemented by pushing the return address on the stack and then jumping to the branch target address.

In this lab, we'll further explore branching and use the stack point to create subroutine and function call procedure. Preparation Lab Preparation Question Read over the lab and understand the procedures. Procedures Similar to the previous lab. Open MCUXpresso then start a new C/C++ project based on the Freedom board model that you have. In the new project configuration, this time, also select \"pit\" as one of the rename the project then leave all other settings as default. Figure 6.1 Select pit in the project setting In previous labs, we wrote all of our code in assembly language using the .s file extension. In this lab, we are going to explore how to integrate C-code together with assembly code in a single project. The first way of integrating assembly code into a C-program is by using the inline assembler method. __asm volatile (\" \"); Replace (or comment out) the PRINTF \"Hello World\" line with the following: __asm volatile (\" mov r1, #0x75 \"); Build and create the dissambly code (or from the dissambly view window during debug). Find the inline assembly code that you wrote. Take a screenshot of it and confirm that the C-code and the assembly code are the same. Paste your result into the Post-Lab question on blackboard. You can also write multi-line inline assembly code as below. As the __asm function is direct replicate of what you wrote into assembly, you'll need to use newline character to specify a newline in assembly. You can also align your C-code to make it more readable. __asm volatile (\" mov r1, #0x75 \\n\" \" mov r3, #10 \"); Open up Lab 5 and transfer the code from the main label (up to but not including the code within the loop) into inline assembly code and include it into the inline code you have. Another method is to include the assembly code in a .s file into the project. Create a function.s file in the source folder and paste the following extract from Lab 5 into it. .syntax unified @ unified syntax used .cpu cortex-m4 @ cpu is cortex-m4 .thumb @ use thumb encoding .text @ put code in the code section .global function1 @ declare as a global variable .type function1, %function @ set to function type function1: push {r5, lr} @ Save values in the stack mov r5, #8 @ Set initial value for the delay loop delay: subs r5, r5, #1 bne delay pop {r5, pc} @ pop out the saved value from the stack Next, place a function prototype at the top of your code and a function call after your inline assembly code and before the while loop into your main function. Set a breakpoint at the asm function then debug your code. Once the program started, hit resume until it reach the breakpoint then \"Step Into (F5)\" the code and see what happens. You program should jump to the code in your assembly file when it hit the function call. Your task now is to translate the assembly code in the loop portion of Lab5 to C-code without using any assembly code except for moving data into register 5. You can use a for loop or a while loop. After you are done and get the desired result, compare the compiled assembly code with the one we have from Lab5 and comment on the difference. The code that you write should still be on top of the while(1) loop. Copy or take a screenshot of your loop and it's assembly code and paste it into Blackboard. Lastly, we are going to include a periodic interrupt timer (PIT) into our code to generate an interrupt once every second. We'll use the built-in ConfigTools in MCUXpresso for ease of implementation. The ConfigTools allow us to setup components of the processor and the microcontroller board in a quick and fast manner instead of manually coding all the necessary settings. Go to \"ConfigTools > Peripherals\" from the top menu. In the \"Components\" tab, Under \"Peripheral drivers (Device specific)\" add the \"PIT\" configuration components. Under the PIT settings, uncheck \"start channel\". Leave everything default so the setting page should look like this: Figure 6.2 PIT settings Once confirmed, click \"Update Code\" at the top menu button bar and click yes when prompted. The peripherals.c and peripherals.h will not be updated accordingly to include the timer interrupt settings. Next, we'll need to add some code for the interrupt handler and to start the interrupt. Paste the following handler code into your program. void PIT_CHANNEL_0_IRQHANDLER(void) / ISR to process PIT channel 0 interrupts / { PIT_ClearStatusFlags(PIT, PIT_CHANNEL_0, kPIT_TimerFlag); //clear PIT channel 0 interrupt status flag PRINTF(\"*\\r\\n\"); } Then use the following code to start the PIT in your main function. You can put it at the beginning of main after all the initialization or just before the empty while loop. PIT_StartTimer(PIT_PERIPHERAL, PIT_CHANNEL_0); Build and debug. Open a serial monitor to see the serial output. Let the program run and you should see an \"*\" being printed every second. Verify with a watch that the output is once per second. Take a screenshot of your serial monitor output and paste it into blackboard. Post-Lab Questions Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the following post-lab question(s) on Blackboard. Due one week after the lab.

Open MCUXpresso then start a new C/C++ project based on the Freedom board model that you have. In the new project configuration, we can keep everything to default as we won't be using the timer interrupt. First, we'll setup the GPIO for the LED output using assembly code. Create a file called function.s in the source folder. Write the following code to it. In the code, we created two functions, one for setting up the pins as GPIO output and another for turning the LED on and off. If you are using the Freedom K66F board, the pin configurations is difference. Refer to the Freedom K66F board manual for the correct pin number. .syntax unified @ unified syntax used .cpu cortex-m4 @ cpu is cortex-m4 .thumb @ use thumb encoding .text @ put code in the code section .global setup @ declare as a global variable .type setup, %function @ set to function type setup: ldr r1, =0x40048038 @ System Clock Gate register mov r0, #0x00000400 @ enable gating for port B str r0, [r1] @ apply setting ldr r1, =0x4004A058 @ PTB22 PCR register address mov r0, #0x00000100 @ set to GPIO mode str r0, [r1] @ apply setting ldr r1, =0x400FF054 @ GPIOB PDDR register address mov r0, #0x00400000 @ set to output mode str r0, [r1] @ apply setting bx lr .global function1 @ declare as a global variable .type function1, %function @ set to function type function1: ldr r1, =0x400FF040 @ GPIOB PDOR register address led_off: mov r0, #0x00400000 @ set output to HIGH, LED off str r0, [r1] @ apply setting led_on: mov r0, #0x00000000 @ set output to LOW, LED on str r0, [r1] @ apply setting b led_off If you are using the Freedom K66F board, the pin configurations is difference. Refer to the Freedom K66F board manual for the correct pin number. Next, place a \"setup\" and \"function1\" function prototype at the top of your code and function calls before the while loop in your main function. You can also comment out or remove the print statement. Build and run your code in debug mode. Step Over (F6) the initial functions until you get to the setup function. Then Step Into (F5) the led_setup and the function1 function. While you are stepping through the code, the RED led should turn on and off. Take a photo of your led turning on and paste it into Blackboard. Next, we'll setup an interrupt with the onboard switch to control the LED. To do that, we'll use the ConfigTools to help setup the interrupt as setting it up using assembly require knowledge of the vector table (a more lengthy process). Open the ConfigTools > Config Tools Overview windows. Under Pins Functional groups, enable BOARD_InitPins, BOARD_InitBUTTONsPins, BOARD_InitLEDsPins, and BOARD_InitDEBUG_UARTPins. Under Peripherals Functional groups, enable BOARD_InitPeripherals. Close and Update Code. Figure 7.3 Next, open the ConfigTools > Peripherals Windows. On the left hand side, go to the Peripherals tab. Check GPIOC and check Enable interrupt request. Afterward, click Enable custom handler name and we'll name it: SW2_GPIOC_IRQHANDLER. Update code. Figure 7.4 Repeat the same for switch 3 in GPIOA. Name the handler as SW3_GPIOA_IRQHANDLER. Lastly, add the following two functions at the end of your program (outside of your main function) and comment out or remove the function call to the assembly code. Run your code and the LED should turn on and off as you press the buttons. void SW2_GPIOC_IRQHANDLER(void) //Interrupt Service Routine for SW2 { // clear interrupt flag set by button SW2 connected to pin PTC6 GPIO_PortClearInterruptFlags(GPIOC, 1U << 6U); LED_RED_ON(); // turn ON RED LED } void SW3_GPIOA_IRQHANDLER(void) //Interrupt Service Routine for SW3 { // clear interrupt flag set by button SW3 connected to pin PTA4 GPIO_PortClearInterruptFlags(GPIOA, 1U << 4U); LED_RED_OFF(); // turn OFF RED LED }","title":"Procedures"},{"location":"seh500/lab7/#post-lab-questions","text":"Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the following post-lab question(s) on Blackboard.

Procedures Part 1: PWM Output vs DAC Output In Part 1, we'll set up a PWM and a DAC to compare the difference between the output. Connect a PWM output pin to CH1 of the DSO. Refer to the mbed board pages to identify which pin is a PWM pin. Connect a DAC output pin to CH2 of the DSO. Refer to the mbed board pages to identify which pin is a DAC pin. Upload the following code to generate a PWM and a DAC output. Remember, you'll need to replace PTXX with the PWM pin that you are using. int main() { // setup pins PwmOut pwm(PTXX); // replace with a PWM pin AnalogOut aout(DAC0_OUT); // pwm settings pwm.period(0.02f); // 50Hz pwm, 0.02s period printf(\"Program started!\\r\\n\"); // added to test serial while (true) { // loop to cycle from 0% to 100% for (float i = 0.0f; i < 1.0f; i += 0.01f) { aout = i; // set DAC out % pwm = i; // set PWM duty cycle % // delay for 10ms, 1000ms for each ramp up ThisThread::sleep_for(10ms); } // loop to cycle from 100% to 0% for (float i = 1.0f; i > 0.0f; i -= 0.01f) { aout = i; // set DAC out % pwm = i; // set PWM duty cycle % // delay for 10ms, 1000ms for each ramp down ThisThread::sleep_for(10ms); } } } Turn on the DSO and run the program. You should see something similar to the figure below on your DSO except it'll be a triangular wave instead of a sine wave. Figure 3.1 DAC and PWM output Lab Question: What circuit should you apply to the PWM output if you want to see the same waveform as the DAC output? Keep the DSO connected. Part 2: ADC Input Next, we'll connect the ADC to an analog voltage input so it can be read into the microcontroller. The voltage signal will come from the bench power supply. To prevent damaging the ADC, we'll first use a voltage division to halve the signal. Never connect the power supply directly to the ADC without a resistor. Figure 3.2 Voltage division circuit for ADC input Assemble the voltage division circuit above on your breadboard and connect the voltage divider output to an analog input pin. Vs will be provided by the bench power supply. Ensure the power supply output is OFF. Optionally, you can use a potentiometer to achieve the same. As a precaution, we only want to supply a maximum of 3.3V to the ADC pin, this means the power supply output should never to above 6.6V. Set the power supply output to 1V. Add the following code in the main function of your code but before the while loop to set up an analog input pin. Remember, you'll need to replace PTXX with the PWM pin that you are using. int main() { ... AnalogIn ain(PTXX); // replace with a ADC pin ... } Next, replace the while loop with the following code so we are controlling the DAC output and the PWM duty cycle with the analog input. while (true) { i = ain; // read ADC aout = i; // set DAC out % pwm = i; // set PWM duty cycle % // delay for 10ms, 1000ms for each ramp up ThisThread::sleep_for(100ms); } Next, let's print the reading out as well. Modify your code to include the following respectively. while (true) { ... // print the percentage, 16 bit normalized values, and something we understand printf(\"percentage: %3.3f%% \", ain.read() * 100.0f); printf(\"normalized: 0x%04X \", ain.read_u16()); printf(\"normalized: %3.3fV \\n\", ain * 3.3); // % * 3.3V ... } Per Minimal printf and snprintf , as of mbed OS 6, printf no longer print floating point by default to save memory. In order to enable printing of floating point value, enable it by creating a file called mbed_app.json in the root project folder and add the following code to it. { \"target_overrides\": { \"*\": { \"target.printf_lib\": \"std\" } } } Turn on the power supply output and run the program.

Figure 3.2 Voltage division circuit for ADC input Assemble the voltage division circuit above on your breadboard and connect the voltage divider output to an analog input pin. Vs will be provided by the bench power supply. Ensure the power supply output is OFF. Optionally, you can use a potentiometer to achieve the same. As a precaution, we only want to supply a maximum of 3.3V to the ADC pin, this means the power supply output should never to above 6.6V. Set the power supply output to 1V.

Procedures Part 1: Onboard I2C Accelerometer and Magnetometer In Part 1, we'll take a look at how to get reading from the onboard accelerometer and magnetometer. Check to see if the accelerometer is assembled on your board. NXP had a production change in 2023 and no longer assembles the FXOS8700CQ onto the Freedom board. If your board is missing the accelerometer chip (as shown in Figure 4.1 below), this part of the Lab will not work. The location U8 on the Freedom Board should be assembled with the FXOS8700CQ accelerometer chip. Figure 4.1 Freedom Board with missing FXOS8700CQ accelerometer chip To use the FXOS8700CQ, you'll need to add the FXOS8700CQ library to your project. Start Mbed Studio then go to File > Add Library to Active Program. When prompted, provide the following link https://os.mbed.com/teams/NXP/code/FXOS8700Q/ . The I2C pins used to connect to the accelerometer for the Freedom board are as follows: K64F K66F SDA PTE25 PTD9 SCL PTE24 PTD8 Start your program with the following code to include the proper library and set up I2C. #include \"mbed.h\" #include \"FXOS8700Q.h\" I2C i2c(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL); // replace with I2C pins Next, we'll create the accelerometer and magnetometer objects using the I2C object we created and the accelerometer's address.

Refer to the FXOS8700Q libraries for other library functions and reading you can get. Lab Question: Try getting readings from different axes to figure out which direction is X, Y, and Z? When there is acceleration in an axis, you'll get acceleration reading on that axis (including gravity). Part 2: Visualize I2C Signal Power off the Freedom board and connect the SDA pin to CH1 and the SCL pin to CH2 of the oscilloscope. If you are using the K66F board, use I2C1 at PTC11 and PTC10 for this part of the lab. With the I2C code running, adjust the oscilloscope to see the full I2C data frame. Use the \"Serial\" option under Measure on the right of the face plate to align the I2C signal. If Serial measurement is not available, you might need to do this manually. If you cannot see the I2C signal, decrease the delay in each loop so data are sent more often and use \"Single\" reading instead of continuous readings. Lab Question: Using the figure below as a reference, identify the start condition, the address, ACK, data, and stop condition of your I2C signal. You should be able to identify the address you are sending from Part 1.

If these moving charges are in a wire \u2014 that is, if the wire is carrying a current \u2014 the wire [will] also experience a force. Source: University Physics Volume 2: Chapter 11.4 The force on a length of a wire is: \\vec F = l \\vec I \\times \\vec B where l is the length of the wire section, \\vec I is the current, and \\vec B is the magnetic field. In this lab, the magnetic force on the small section of magnetic wire used is difficult to measure. As a result, you'll only be observing the effect of the magnetic force qualitatively using right-hand rules. Figure 7.1 Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field B Source: Wikipedia: Lorentz force A solenoid is a type of electromagnet formed by a helical coil of wire whose length is substantially greater than its diameter, which generates a controlled magnetic field. The magnetic field produced by a solenoid can be estimated by: B = {\\mu_0 n I} where: B is the magnetic field (T) \\mu_0 is a constant ( 4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7} ) n is the number of turns per unit length And n = {N \\over L} where: N is the number of turns in the coil L is the length of coil Source: Wikipedia: Solenoid An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet. Source: Wikipedia: Electromagnet The force produced by a solenoid can be estimated by: F = {c A (nI)^2 \\over {2d^2}} where: F is the force (newtons) n is the number of turns per unit length I is the current (amps) c is a constant ( 12.566 \\times 10^{-7} ) A is the area (m^2) d is the distance between the solenoid and the metal Source: Solenoid Force Calculator Materials Breadboard Custom-made magnetic wire apparatus Magnet Solenoid wrapped around ferrous material Paper clips or other small ferrous materials as mass Preparation Lab Preparation Question: Copy the observation tables found in this lab into your notebook. Procedures Part 1 and Part 2 does not have to be completed sequentially. If the materials for Part 1 are not available, Part 2 can be conducted first. Part 1: Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Wire WARNING: the apparatus is VERY FRAGILE! Do not bench the apparatus as it can break easily. The custom apparatus for Part 1 of this lab consists of a thin wire in a silicon tube connected with two 100\u03a9 resistors in series to limit the current flow. The silicon tube is used to protect the thin magnetic wire. When using the apparatus, do NOT clip both ends of the apparatus with an alligator clip. Only attach one alligator clip to one of the connection lead and manually use the second alligator to touch the other connection lead. Obtain a breadboard, a custom-made magnetic wire apparatus, and a magnet. Carefully place the custom-made magnetic wire apparatus on a breadboard and a magnet with the black side up under the wire (between the apparatus and the breadboard) (magnet not shown in the figure below). Figure 7.2 Set up a power supply as described below but do NOT connect it to the circuit and do NOT turn on the output. Use the \u201cDisplay Limit\u201d button to see the power supply settings Set the voltage output to 5.0V Set the current output limit to 100mA Connect one alligator clip from the power supply to one of the connection leads of the apparatus. Do NOT connect the second alligator clip. Hold onto the second alligator clip from the power supply then turn on the power supply output. NOTE: In the next step, the output of the power supply will drop to zero because we are effectively shorting the power supply with the magnetic wire. NOTE: If there is doubt that the magnetic wire might be broken, the continuity of the apparatus can be verified by measuring the resistance between the two leads. If there is resistance, the wire is still connecting the two resistors. Quickly touch then remove the second alligator that you are holding to the second alligator clip. Observe the thin wire closely, it should move slightly from its normal position. If a movement cannot be observed, observe more closely as the movement is very small. If movement still cannot be observed, carefully hold the board firmly against the workbench to reduce vibration, increment the current limit by 25mA then try again. Do not exceed 300mA. Lab Question 1: Draw a diagram of the apparatus set up (wire and magnet) in your notebook with the current flow direction and the thin wire movement direction. Carefully remove, then flip, and re-place the magnet under the magnetic wire so the red tape side of the magnet is facing up. Repeat steps 5 with the flipped magnet. Disconnect the alligator clip from the apparatus and switch it with the second alligator clip so the current flow in the opposite direction. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the opposite current. Lab Question 2: Comment on your observation and use it to determine the polarity (which end is the north pole and which end is the south pole) of the magnet. The magnetic field line for a magnet is shown below. Figure 7.3 Part 2: Magnetic Force of a Solenoid There are various custom-made solenoids wrapped around a ferrous core for Part 2 of the lab. Ferrous materials have magnetic properties that allow for magnetic attraction. When a solenoid is wrapped around a ferrous core that is naturally non-magnetic, an electromagnet is created when an electric current flow through the coil to produce a magnetic field. Obtain a custom solenoid for Part 2 of this lab, a magnet, and a few paper clips or ferrous materials to be used as mass. Lab Question 3: Estimate the turns per unit length for the solenoid by counting and filling in the table below: Length, L # of turns, N n = N / L Solenoid Set up the power supply as described below but do NOT connect it to the circuit and do NOT turn on the output. Use the \u201cDisplay Limit\u201d button to see the power supply settings Set the voltage output to 10.0V Set the current output limit to 0.1A Connect one alligator clip to one lead of the solenoid and the other alligator clip to the other lead of the solenoid. Figure 7.4 Turn on the output of the power supply then try to lift a paper clip using the head side of the bolt as shown above. Slowly increase or decrease the current limit until just one paper clip can be lifted. Record the current in the table below. Stop the power output and let the coil cool down between trials. NOTE: At the end of each trial, use the permanent magnet to remove any residual magnetism from the electromagnet. Attach the permanent magnet to the electro-magnet then repeat a few times with a revised polarity. Lab Question 4: Repeat step 5 but try to lift two paperclips then three and so on. Always add a paperclip to the first paperclip. Stop the experiment when the current limit is at 3A or 10 paper clip is lifted. Afterward, calculate the magnetic field and force using the formula in the lab description at each step: # of paperclip lifted Current (< 3A) Estimated Magnetic Field Estimated Magnetic Force 1 2 3 ... Lab Question 5: Comment on the mathematic relationship between the number of paperclips lifted (force of an electromagnet and the magnetic field). Lab Question 6: (Post-Lab) Plot both magnetic field (y-axis) and force (y-axis) vs the number of paperclips lifted (x-axis) then calculate the coefficient for the trend line. Does it agree with the nature (linear, exponential, etc.) of the mathematic relationship? Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate you've completed the lab and written down all your observation. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab. Post-Lab Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the post-lab question(s) on blackboard.

The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.

Do not bench the apparatus as it can break easily. The custom apparatus for Part 1 of this lab consists of a thin wire in a silicon tube connected with two 100\u03a9 resistors in series to limit the current flow. The silicon tube is used to protect the thin magnetic wire. When using the apparatus, do NOT clip both ends of the apparatus with an alligator clip. Only attach one alligator clip to one of the connection lead and manually use the second alligator to touch the other connection lead. Obtain a breadboard, a custom-made magnetic wire apparatus, and a magnet. Carefully place the custom-made magnetic wire apparatus on a breadboard and a magnet with the black side up under the wire (between the apparatus and the breadboard) (magnet not shown in the figure below). Figure 7.2 Set up a power supply as described below but do NOT connect it to the circuit and do NOT turn on the output. Use the \u201cDisplay Limit\u201d button to see the power supply settings Set the voltage output to 5.0V Set the current output limit to 100mA Connect one alligator clip from the power supply to one of the connection leads of the apparatus. Do NOT connect the second alligator clip. Hold onto the second alligator clip from the power supply then turn on the power supply output. NOTE: In the next step, the output of the power supply will drop to zero because we are effectively shorting the power supply with the magnetic wire. NOTE: If there is doubt that the magnetic wire might be broken, the continuity of the apparatus can be verified by measuring the resistance between the two leads. If there is resistance, the wire is still connecting the two resistors. Quickly touch then remove the second alligator that you are holding to the second alligator clip. Observe the thin wire closely, it should move slightly from its normal position. If a movement cannot be observed, observe more closely as the movement is very small. If movement still cannot be observed, carefully hold the board firmly against the workbench to reduce vibration, increment the current limit by 25mA then try again. Do not exceed 300mA. Lab Question 1: Draw a diagram of the apparatus set up (wire and magnet) in your notebook with the current flow direction and the thin wire movement direction. Carefully remove, then flip, and re-place the magnet under the magnetic wire so the red tape side of the magnet is facing up. Repeat steps 5 with the flipped magnet. Disconnect the alligator clip from the apparatus and switch it with the second alligator clip so the current flow in the opposite direction. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the opposite current. Lab Question 2: Comment on your observation and use it to determine the polarity (which end is the north pole and which end is the south pole) of the magnet.

The number of positive charges and negative charges is usually equal. Neutral objects neither attract nor repel each other electrically.

Students who did not complete the lab preparation will be asked not to join the lab and receive a grade of ZERO (0) for the lab. Lab preparation must be done individually in the lab notebook. Lab Preparation Question Summarize the steps for this Lab in your notebook as the computer in the lab room will NOT be available for this lab. Describe how you can neutralize your hand from electric charges in the lab room using the technique mentioned in the lab manual. Copy and fill in the following observation table in your notebook (except for the observation column): Step Object 1 Rubbed with Object 2 Rubbed with Observation (Attract/Repel) 6 Plastic Straw Wool Plastic Straw Wool 8 Plastic Straw Wool 9 Plastic Straw 12 13 Procedures If not enough stands are available, work in groups of 2. All questions in the lab must be answered individually and every member must individually demostrate completion of the lab. Place and secure the stand on the table. Attach a paper clip onto a strong then hang the paper clip about 5cm below the end hook of the stand. The paper clip is used to hold a plastic straw. Carefully secure a plastic straw onto the paper clip so it evenly sits on the paper clip and it's free to rotate on the stand. NOTE: In some instant, it might be beneficial to hang the stand off the side of the table to allow full rotation of the straw once it's attached to the paper clip. Technique and attention to detail is the key to this lab and in any of your future lab. Remove the plastic straw from the paper clip then rub both ends of a plastic straw with the wool cloth. ONLY handle the middle of the straw as handling the ends you've charged will alter its charge. Once charged, carefully suspend the plastic straw from the stand using the paper clip. ONLY handle the middle of the straw. What you've done is charging the plastic straw NEGATIVELY (free electron from the wool cloth is transferred onto the surface of the plastic straw). Note: If your hand touched the charged portion of the straw, your hand will discharge the straw causing the charged portion to return to neutral. Next, rub one end of a second plastic straw in the same way then hold it close to the first plastic straw (without touching) . Remember, do not hold the straw on the side that you've charged. Observe the (attractive or repulsive) force exerted on the first plastic straw suspended from the stand. Lab Question 1: What interaction between the straws do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Lab Question 2: Which electrostatics law have you confirmed? Explain your answer by specifying the charge in each plastic straw. Ensure your hand is not charged by placing your palm on the metal surface or the rubber mat on the workbench. Then discharge the second plastic straw by slowly touching it (not rubbing) with your hand then neutralize your hand. Repeat this a few times until the second straw no longer exerts any force on the first straw. Note: Technique is critical. You should often discharge yourself by placing your palm on the metal surface or the rubber mat of the workbench. We can assume they are connected to the ground (earth) and are electrically neutral. Recharge the second (now neutral) plastic straw by rubbing it with the plastic wrap. Hold it close to the first wool-charged plastic straw and observe the nature of the force. Lab Question 3: What interaction between the straws do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Lab Question 4: Use your observation to predict what type of charge is on plastic wrap-rubbed straw (positive or negative). ie. Did the plastic wrap-rubbed straw gain/lose electrons? Remember: It was previously given that the wool-rubbed straw is charged negatively. Discharge the second plastic straw. Take a glass rod and charge it using the wool cloth. Hold it close to the first wool-charged plastic straw. WARNING! The glass rod is fragile! Handle with care! Lab Question 5: What interaction between the straw and the rod do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Use your observation to predict what type of charge is on the wool-rubbed glass rod (positive or negative). ie. Did the wool-rubbed glass rod gain/lose electrons? Discharge the glass rod. WARNING! The glass rod is fragile! Handle with care! Lab Question 6: From the results in your observation table, which materials (plastic straw, wool, plastic wrap, glass rod) do you think will most likely gain electrons and which will most likely lose electrons? For example: We defined the straw as negatively charged when rubbed with wool. Therefore, the straw is more likely to gain electrons than the wool. The steps above demonstrate the triboelectric effects and electrostatic force between two charged objects. In the next steps, you will observe the force between a charged object and a neutral object. Touch a metal surface on the workbench to ensure your hand is not charged. Discharge the plastic straw on the stand and a glass rod with your hand until there is no electrostatic force between them when holding them near one another. Leaving the plastic straw neutral, charge the glass rob with the wool cloth. Hold the glass rod close to the plastic straw. Lab Question 7: What interaction between the rod and the straw do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Why is the neutral plastic straw attracted to the glass rob? Explain the phenomenon and discuss how this can draw you to the wrong conclusion regarding the charge on each object. Refer to Chapter 5.2 in the University Physic Volume 2 textbook if required. The steps above demonstrate transferring of charges on the surface of insulators. In the next step, you will observe what will happen when charging a conducting object. Leaving the neutral plastic straw suspended. Rub one end of a steel rod with the wool cloth then hold it near the neutral plastic straw. Lab Question 8: What interaction between the rod and the straw do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Explain the phenomenon. Refer to Chapter 5.2 in the University Physic Volume 2 textbook if required. Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate you've completed the lab and written down all your observation. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab. Bonus Using the concept you've acquired from this steps above, extend your observation table and determine where is the Plastic Rod or Slik or Cotton or Wooden Rod / Dowel is on the triboelectric series in Question 6. (5% of Lab Work mark for each materials). You must show your expiremental steps and observation. Read the following cases to understand the logic: Case 1: Plastic Wrap If Material-A is rubbed with Plastic Wrap, Material-A is positively charged (lose electrons) because the Plastic Wrap is more negative (gain electrons). Case 2: If Material-A rubbed with Material-B is attracted to Material-C rubbed with Material-B, then we know the charge on Material-A is opposite to the charge on Material-C. However, to determine which one is positively charged and which on is negatively charged, we must know the properties of Material-B relative to Material-A and Material-C. As a result, always start your experiment with the known material (Plastic Wrap). Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate that you've completed the lab and written down all your observations.

Research: Besides voltage, resistance, and current, list two other electronics-related properties a modem DMM can measure. In your words, explain the difference between the two ON/OFF settings (Power ON/OFF and Output ON/OFF) of the DC power supply we use in this lab. Using Ohm's Law: V = IR , calculate the current through a 1k\u03a9 resistor if 5V of potential difference is applied across the resistor. Procedures Part 1: Safety Ensure that you are wearing your safety glasses, not wearing open-toe shoes, and any long hair must be tied up. At the top of your workbench, you\u2019ll see a red \u201cEmergency Stop\u201d button (shown in Figure 2.8). At any time when the button is in the pressed position, your workbench will be disconnected from the power source. Press this button if there are any issues with your equipment or circuit (such as unusual heat, unusual smell, smoke, spark, or fire). To release the button, twist it as per the symbol on the button and the button will no longer be pressed. Figure 2.8 Emergency Stop Button Ensure the Emergency Stop button is in the released position. Part 2: Digital Multimeter (DMM) and DC Voltage Measurement Assemble the 1k\u03a9 resistor (brown-black-red) from the lab materials onto the breadboard as shown in Figure 2.9. Ensure the two leads of the resistor are on different rows on the breadboard so they are not electrically connected (shorted). The exact tie-point to use within the column doesn't matter are they are electrically connected. Figure 2.9 Identify the digital multimeter (DMM) at your workbench. If there are two DMMs, use the one on the left-hand side. Disconnect any cables that are plugged into it so the DMM is as shown in Figure 2.10 below. Figure 2.10 Set the DMM to DC voltage measurement mode as follows: If the DMM is not already powered on, push the power button (1). Once the DMM is ON, push the DC voltage (DCV) measurement mode button (4). If the \u201cRange\u201d indicator (3) is not showing \u201cAuto\u201d, press the menu button under \u201cRange\u201d (2) and change it to \u201cAuto\u201d. Identify the two cables that are next to the DMM with a banana connector on one end and an alligator clip on the other end. Connect the banana connector from the red cable to the red terminal labelled with \u201cHI\u201d under \u201cInput V\u03a9\u25ba|\u201d (5). Connect the banana connector from the black cable to the black terminal labelled with \u201cLO\u201d under \u201cInput V\u03a9\u25ba|\u201d (6) Figure 2.11 Verify the cables are connected as shown in Figure 2.5 above. At this point, your DMM is set up to measure direct current (DC) voltage. We\u2019ll be discussing direct current voltage during class. Remember this configuration for future labs and careers as measuring DC voltage is a very important skill for working with electronics. Identify the DC power supply at your workbench. If there are two DC power supplies, use the one that's most similar to the one shown. Disconnect any cables that are plugged in so it is as shown in Figure 2.11 below. Figure 2.12 Turn on the DC power supply (1) and then press the \u201cDisplay Limit\u201d button (2). Select the appropriate output voltage range (10) and use the lowest possible setting for a 5V output. In Figure 2.6 above, the lowest setting is \"15V, 7A\", however, the lowest output range varies between different models of power supply. Adjust the voltage output to +5.000V (9) using the digit selector (6) and the adjustment knob (7). Depending on the model of the power supply, the number of significant figures of the voltage output might be different. Identify the black cable with two leads that are next to the DC power supply with a banana connector on one end and an alligator clip on the other end. Connect the red banana connector from the cable to the red \u201cOutput\u201d terminal labelled with \u201c+\u201d (9) NOTE: In some models of power supply, there might be multiple output terminals. connect to the appropriate output terminal depending on the output range you selected earlier. Connect the black banana connector from the cable to the black \u201cOutput\u201d terminal labelled with \u201c-\u201c (10) You\u2019ve now set up the power supply for DC output. Attach a jumper cable to each of the alligator clips as shown in Figure 2.12. It can be jumper wire of any type and colour. Figure 2.12 SHORT CIRCUIT WARNING: Ensure the exposed portion of the red alligator clip or wire is NOT touching the exposed portion of the black alligator clip or wire. Connect the jumper wire from the red cable of the power supply to the same row as the first resistor lead. Then connect the jumper wire from the black cable of the power supply to the same row as the second resistor lead to assemble the circuit below. Figure 2.13 Connect the jumper wire from the red cable of the DMM to the same row as the first resistor lead. Then connect the jumper wire from the black cable of the DMM to the same row as the second resistor lead. Figure 2.14 Press the \"Display Limit\" button (2) on the power supply again and verify the voltage is adjusted to +5.000V and the banana cables are connected. Also, verify that the exposed portion of the red alligator clip is NOT touching the exposed portion of the black alligator clip. Turn on the power supply output by pressing the Output On/Off button (8). NOTE: There is a difference between the power supply being ON/OF and the power supply OUTPUT being ON/OFF. The power supply can be ON with its power output OFF. Notice that the DMM should now read about +5V, similar to as shown in Figure 2.15. Make a note of the range value beside the \u201cAuto\u201d on the DMM display. Figure 2.15 With the power supply output ON, adjust the output voltage to +13V. Note: If the output range does not allow you to go to 13V, switch the output range (10) and terminals as necessary. Lab Question 1: What happened to the Range setting on the DMM? If you don't notice the change, decrease the output voltage back to 5V and try again. Afterward, decrease the voltage of the DC power supply slowly to 5V. Lab Question 2: At what power supply voltage did the DMM change back to \u201cAuto 10V\u201d? How are the number of digits and decimal places the same or different when the voltage range changes? What does that mean for the accuracy of the readings? Using the DMM reading only, adjust the output voltage of the DC power supply so the reading on the DMM will display +1.000V. Note: Switch the output range and terminal as necessary. Lab Question 3: What is the output voltage of the DC power supply? Do they agree exactly with each other? If not, which one is higher and what is the percentage difference? /( % diff = diff / expected value /) Adjust the DC power supply output voltage to +1.000V then change the voltage Range on the DMM from \"Auto\" to \"100mV\" using the Range selection button. The DMM should display \"OVERLOAD\" because the 1V output from the power supply is higher than the maximum 100mV range that can be measured. Manually change the DMM \"Range\" setting and power supply voltage output according to the table below. Then record the voltage reading on the DMM in the and do this for DC output voltage of +1V, +2V, +5V, and +10V. NOTE: The reading might fluctuate but record at least 4 significant digits to the best of your ability in estimating AND record all LEADING ZEROS . Output: +1V Output: +2V Output: +5V Output: +10V Range: 100mV OVERLOAD Range: 1V Range: 10V Range: 100V Range: 1000V Lab Question 4: If we want the most precise reading, what is the best setting for each DC output voltage in the table? Circle the most precise reading for each voltage output in the table above. Change the DMM \"Range\" setting back to Auto then set the power supply output back to 5V. Take a look at the current output value (Figure 2.11 (8)) from the power supply. Lab Question 5: Does this value agree with the Ohm's law calculation you made earlier in the pre-lab? Turn off the DC power supply and disconnect the alligator clips. Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate that you've completed the lab and written down all your observations. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab.","title":"Lab 2 : Digital Multimeter, Power Supply, and Ohm's Law"},{"location":"ses250/lab2/#lab-2-digital-multimeter-power-supply-and-ohms-law","text":"Seneca College SES250 Electromagnatics","title":"Lab 2 : Digital Multimeter, Power Supply, and Ohm's Law"},{"location":"ses250/lab2/#purposes","text":"To learn how to operate the power supply and digital multimeter (DMM) To become familiar with measurement techniques of direct current (DC) To study the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current To verify Ohm's Law","title":"Purposes"},{"location":"ses250/lab2/#objectives","text":"Operate a DC power supply Setup and read measurements from a digital multimeter (DMM) Assemble electronic components onto a breadboard Measure voltage from a breadboard using a digital multimeter (DMM)","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"ses250/lab2/#important-rules-for-this-lab","text":"Any signal (voltage, current) must be adjusted to the specified value (amplitude and/or frequency) before applying them to a circuit.

Description If you don't remember how to operate the DMM and read the resistor colour band, refer to the description section of Lab 2 . Voltage Measurement In Lab 2, we used the DMM as a voltmeter to measure voltage (or the potential difference) across two nodes in a circuit. When measuring voltage, the DMM is connected in parallel with the circuit as shown in Figure 2.14a from Lab 2 . An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance so energy will not be dissipated by the test equipment. In practice, the internal resistance of a voltmeter is in the M\u03a9 range. Current Measurement Most modern DMMs are capable of being used as an ammeter for measuring current through a circuit. Differing from voltage measurement, current measurement is made by connecting the DMM is series with the circuit as shown in Figure 3.1. An ideal ammeter has zero resistance so energy will not be dissipated by the test equipment. In practice, the internal resistance of a voltmeter is in the \u03a9 range. Figure 3.1 Current Measuring Circuit Resistance Measurement Most modern DMMs are also capable of measuring the resistance through a circuit. This feature, however, is most often used to measure the resistance of a single resistor. To measure resistance, put the DMM in resistance measuring mode then connect the DMM in parallel with the circuit. TinkerCAD Breadboard Simulator There are many breadboard simulators available online. In particular, TinkerCAD Circuit is a nice tool that you can use to practice assembling a circuit with a virtual breadboard. See the diagram below as an example. Use this tool to help you prepare for this and future labs.

Clearly show which tie point the wire, resistor, DMM, and power supply be attached to. Use TinkerCAD Circuit to help with your understanding of breadboard and component wiring. You may also simulate all the steps as preparation for the lab. Refer the Lab 2 Figure 2.13 for a breadboard diagram example. Copy the table in Lab Questions 3, 4 and 5 into your notebook. Calculate the theoretical reading of the voltmeter and ammeter of the circuit in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 for a supply voltage of 1V, 2V, 5V, and 10V. Procedures Part 1: Resistance Measurement Take out a 1k\u03a9 resistor and a 10k\u03a9 resistor from your lab kit. Lab Question 1: Write down the colour code of each resistor then determine their resistance value using the resistor colour chart in Lab 2 . Use the table below to help you determine the resistance value of each resistor. Leave the \"Measured \u03a9\" blank. Example: 1st Band 2nd Band Multiplier Nonimal \u03a9 Measured \u03a9 % Error Colour Brown Black Red Total - - Value 1 0 x 10 ^ 2 1 k\u03a9 1.013 k\u03a9 1.3% Turn on the one of DMM at your workbench and turn it into the \u201c\u03a9 2W\u201d (1) resistance measurement mode. Ensure the banana plugs are connected to the resistance input terminals as shown in Figure 3.3 (2)(3). Figure 3.3 DMM Resistance Mode Connect the red alligator clip of the DMM to one lead of one of the resistors and the black alligator clip to the other lead of the resistor. Lab Question 2: Write down the measured resistance (at least 3 significant figures) in the \"Measured \u03a9\" column of the table you created in the pre-lab. Does this value agree with the normal resistor value according to the colour band value? What is the % error? Is the error within the tolerance of the resistor (indicated by the tolerance band)? Repeat step 3 for the second resistor then disconnect the DMM from the resistor. Part 2: Voltage and Current Measurement Ensure the DC power supply is OFF. Locate its red and black cables then attach jumper wires to the alligator clips as shown in Figure 2.12 from Lab 2 . Set up one of the DMMs to voltage mode (Refer to Lab 2 if you don't remember the procedure) and ensure the banana cables are connected properly to the DMM for voltage measure. Connect jumper wires to each of the alligator clips. Set up the other DMM at your workbench to the current mode (DCI) by holding the \"SHIFT\" button (1) and the \"DCV\" button (2). Afterward, ensure the banana cable is connected properly to the DMM for voltage measurement by connecting the black banana cable to the \"LO\" Input (3) and the red banana cable to the \"3A\" Input (4) as shown in Figure 3.4. Then Connect jumper wires to each of the alligator clips. Figure 3.4 Next, insert one of the resistors onto a breadboard the same way as shown in Figure 2.9 from Lab 2 then connect the jumper wires from DMMs and the power supply to form the following circuit. Notice the voltmeter (DMM in DC voltage mode (DCV)) is connected in parallel with the resistor and the Ammeter (DMM in DC current mode (DCI)) is connected in series with the circuit. A small example of some of the connections is shown. Figure 3.5 Double-verify that the circuit is assembled properly and that there is no short circuit. Tips: Follow the flow of the current on your physical circuit from the positive (+) terminal of the power supply to the resistor, then to the ammeter, then to the negative terminal of the power supply to verify proper connections. Turn on the DC power supply and set the output to 5V then turn on the output. Verify the voltage reading on the DMM agrees with the output of the DC power supply then turn it off .

Any linear electrical network containing only voltage sources, current sources and resistances can be replaced at terminals A\u2013B by an equivalent combination of a voltage source V_{th} in a series connection with a resistance R_{th} . Figure 5.1 Th\u00e9venin equivalent circuit The equivalent voltage V_{th} is the voltage obtained at terminals A\u2013B of the network with terminals A\u2013B open-circuited. The equivalent resistance R_{th} is the resistance that the circuit between terminals A and B would have if all ideal voltage sources in the circuit were replaced by a short circuit and all ideal current sources were replaced by an open circuit. If terminals A and B are connected to one another, the current flowing from A and B will be V_{th} over R_{th} . This means that R_{th} could alternatively be calculated as V_{th} divided by the short-circuit current between A and B when they are connected together.

An instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is connected to a circuit. The power supply and/or the function generator must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit. Description Function Generator A function generator is a piece of electronic test equipment or software used to generate different types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave, square wave, triangular wave, and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single shots. Figure 6.1 Keysight 33500B Function Generator In the electronics lab, you will be using a Keysight 33500B (or similar) Function Generator. Its manual can be found here: Function Generator Manual Source: Wikipedia: Function Generator Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) An oscilloscope, or DSO (for the more modern digital storage oscilloscope), is a type of electronic test instrument that graphically displays varying signal voltages, usually as a calibrated two-dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time. The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion, and others. Originally, the calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Figure 6.2 Keysight 33500B Function Generator In the electronics lab, you will be using a Keysight DSO-X 2002A (or similar) Digital Storage Oscilloscope. Its manual can be found here: DSO Manual Source: Wikipedia: Oscilloscope Materials Preparation Lab Preparation Question: List 5 waveform that can be generated by the function generator used in this lab. Read through the lab manual and list the button(s) that you need to press to turn the output of the function generator on and off. In your own word, explain the difference between the 50\u03a9 and High-Z output mode of the function generator used in this lab. Procedures Identify the Digital Oscilloscope at your workbench. Disconnect any cable plugged into it so it is as shown below. Figure 6.3 Turn on the oscilloscope with the power button (8.3-1) if it is not already on. Identify the two cables with a BNC connector beside the oscilloscope. Connect the BNC cables to the CH1 (8.3-4) and CH2 connectors of the oscilloscope as shown. Figure 6.4 Press the CH1 On/Off button (6.3-6) so CH1 is on (button lights up green). Press the CH2 On/Off button so CH2 is off (no light showing at the button). The bright lines on the DSO display the waveform of the signal as a function of time. When there is no signal, the waveform is a flat line. If you don't see a flat line, that means your DSO is displaying amplified electronic noise from the environment. Don't worry if you don't see a flat line for this step of the lab. Lab Question 1: How many signal line(s) (6.3-13, bright solid horizontal line) do you see on the display? What is the colour of the line(s)? Press the CH2 On/Off button to turn CH2 on (button lights up green) then press the Auto Scale button (6.3-9) again. Lab Question 2: How many signal line(s) do you see on the display? What is the colour of the line(s)? You can adjust the vertical position of those signal lines for measurement or display purposes. Turn the CH1 vertical position knob (6.3-5) until the CH1 signal line is reasonably lined up vertically centred on the display. Try changing the vertical position of the CH2 signal line as well. Afterward, line up both signal lines vertically centred on the display. One line will be on top of the other line. Modern DSOs are complex test instruments with a lot of functionality. It is a very useful tool once you understand how to use it. The more you use and play with the tool, the more familiar you'll get. Turn off CH2. Identify the Function Generator at your workbench. Disconnect any cable plug into it so it is as shown below. Figure 6.5 Identify the cable with a BNC connector beside the function generator and connect it to the Output of the function generator (6.5-3). Afterward, push the power button (6.5-1) to turn on the function generator. After the function generator is turned on, we'll set up a 1kHz Sine wave, press the Waveforms button (6.5-7) and select Sine waveform mode from button menus (6.5-2). Then press the Parameters button (6.5-8) and use the keypad, digit selector buttons (6.5-5), and the adjustment knob (8.5-6) to set the following: Frequency: 1.000 kHz ( Note: pay attention to the number of 0s in kHz You can adjust the Units as necessary.) Amplitude: 100.0 mVpp (default setting) Offset: 0.000 V (default setting) Phase: 0\u00b0 (default setting) Identify the cable connected to the function generator and the alligator clips at the end of the cable connected to CH1 of the oscilloscope. Connect the two red alligator clips together and connect the two black alligator clips together. WARNING: Ensure the exposed portion of the red alligator clip is NOT touching the exposed portion of the black alligator clip. Figure 6.6 Once the cables are connected and the waveform is set, push the channel button on the function generator (6.7-4) then turn the output to \u201cOn\u201d (6.7-9). Figure 6.7 You should now see some signal on the DSO. If not, push the Auto Scale button on the oscilloscope (8.3-9). You should see a waveform that is similar to that shown in the figure below. Figure 6.8 Turn the time division knob (6.3-12) and the horizontal position knob (6.3-11) a few ticks clockwise then counter-clockwise. Lab Question 3: What effect do the time division knob and the horizontal position knob have on the waveform? The grey-white vertical lines (6.8-2) on the oscilloscope chart are called time division lines and the top right of the display shows the time divisor (6.8-4). In the figure above, the time divisor is set to 200.0\u03bcs/ which means each time division line represents 200.0\u03bcs in the time domain. The are a total of 10 time divisions in the display. Lab Question 4: Find two peaks in the signal waveform then count the number of time divisions in each period of the sine wave. Afterward, calculate the frequency of the sine wave using: f = 1 / T where f is the frequency in [Hz] and T is the period in [s]. Does it agree with the output of the function generator? You can adjust the horizontal position of the sine wave with the horizontal position knob to help with counting if necessary. Change the output of the function generator to a different frequency such as 500Hz and another waveform such as square and triangle then see how it is displayed on the oscilloscope. Afterward, put the function generator back to a sine wave at 1kHz. Press the Measurement (Meas) button (6.3-8) on the oscilloscope. In the measurement menu that shows up, use the menu buttons (6.3-2) and menu selector knob (6.3-3) to clear all measurements with the Clear Meas option. Then, add Frequency (Freq) and peak-to-peak voltage (Pk-Pk) for measurement. Ensure the Source channel is set to 1 at the lower left corner of the menu. The two measurements should now show up in the measurement list on the right-hand side. If a mistake is made, press Clear Meas to remove a measurement. Lab Question 5: Does the frequency measurement agree with your calculation above? Turn the time division knob slowly so the waveform expands and compresses horizontally. Turn it from 10 periods to only a portion of the waveform shown. Lab Question 6: At what time divisor does the measurement starts to become invalid? How many periods of the waveform are shown when it becomes invalid? What comment can you make on how the oscilloscope calculates the freq measurement (in terms of the waveform required to be displayed on the screen)? The grey-white horizontal line (6.8-1) on the oscilloscope display is called a voltage division line and at the top left of the display shows the voltage divisor (6.8-3). In the figure above, 50.0mV/ means each line represents 50.0mV in the voltage range. The are a total of 8 voltage divisions in the display. Lab Question 7: Find the peak and the trough of the signal waveform. Count the number of voltage divisions from the peak to the trough of the sine wave then calculate the peak-to-peak voltage of the sine wave. Does it agree with the peak-to-peak voltage (Pk-Pk) value in the measurement list? Lab Question 8: Is this peak-to-peak voltage (Pk-Pk) value the same or different from the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude (Vpp) value you set at the function generator earlier? Describe how are they the same or different. Turn off the output of the function generator. Reminder: Press the Channel button then Output Off. Afterward, press the Output Load button (6.7-10) and change the setting to \"High-Z\". Then change the amplitude of the Sine wave to 3 Vpp. Reminder: press \u201cParameters\u201d to access the settings. Keep the Offset and Phase at 0. Turn on the output of the function generator. You should now see a 3 V peak-to-peak signal on the oscilloscope. Adjust the voltage division knob (6.3-7) so the sine wave will fit into the screen again. Lab Question 9: What is the voltage divisor value used to achieve this? Then, count the number of voltage divisions or read from the measurement list to find the peak-to-peak voltage of the signal. How does your result compare to the result in the measurements list and to the output setting of the function generator? Read here for an explanation of why there's a difference in output value when using difference output mode. NOTE: Press the CH1 button (6.3-6) and ensure the \u201cCoupling\u201d setting on the oscilloscope at the lower left corner of the display is set as \u201cDC\u201d and the \u201cProbe\u201d setting at the lower right corner is selected as \u201c1X\u201d If not, correct them by pressing and selecting the respective settings and change them with the selector knob (6.3-3). The knob can be turned and pressed. Adjust the settings so that at least three but no more than ten periods are showing on the DSO display and at least four voltage divisions of peak-to-peak voltage. Change the output parameters of the function generator and repeat the scaling process so you are competent with manually scaling an oscilloscope. Lab Question 10: (During-Lab) Demostrate to the lab professor or instructor that you are competent in generating a wave signal from the function generator and manually scaling (non-using auto scale) the display of an oscilloscope to view such signal. Turn off the function generator and disconnect the alligator clips.

An instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is connected to a circuit. The power supply must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit. Description Capacitor A capacitor is an electronic device for storing electrical energy, consisting of two conductors in close proximity and insulated from each other. A simple example of such a storage device is the parallel-plate capacitor. If positive charges with total charge +Q are deposited on one of the conductors and an equal amount of negative charge \u2212Q is deposited on the second conductor, the capacitor is said to have a charge Q. Source: Britannica: capacitor The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor can be calculated using: C = {{\\epsilon_0 A} \\over {s}} where \\epsilon_0 is the permittivity in vacuum and have a value of \\epsilon_0 = {8.854 \\times 10^{-12} {Nm^2 \\over C^2}} , A is the area of the plates, and s is the distance between the plates. Similar to resistors, capacitors use special markings to indicate their values. Since the amount of area for markings on a capacitor is limited, there is also a set of rules for specifying the capacitance value of a capacitor. Manufacturers often use two separate lines for their capacitor markings and these have the following meanings: - First line: capacitance (in pF or \u03bcF) [and tolerance (J=5%, K=10%, M=20%)] - Second line: rated DC voltage [and code for the dielectric material] For a ceramic capacitor, often only a three-digit code is given. The first two digits correspond to the first two digits of the value whilst the third digit is a multiplier which gives the number of zeros to be added to give the value in pF. For example, 104 means 10 x 104 pF = 100nF. Furthermore, some capacitors such as electrolytic capacitors are marked with symbols (\u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d) to indicate the correct polarity. Failure to observe these markings when connecting a capacitor to a circuit can be catastrophic!

A simple example of such a storage device is the parallel-plate capacitor. If positive charges with total charge +Q are deposited on one of the conductors and an equal amount of negative charge \u2212Q is deposited on the second conductor, the capacitor is said to have a charge Q. Source: Britannica: capacitor The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor can be calculated using: C = {{\\epsilon_0 A} \\over {s}} where \\epsilon_0 is the permittivity in vacuum and have a value of \\epsilon_0 = {8.854 \\times 10^{-12} {Nm^2 \\over C^2}} , A is the area of the plates, and s is the distance between the plates. Similar to resistors, capacitors use special markings to indicate their values. Since the amount of area for markings on a capacitor is limited, there is also a set of rules for specifying the capacitance value of a capacitor. Manufacturers often use two separate lines for their capacitor markings and these have the following meanings: - First line: capacitance (in pF or \u03bcF) [and tolerance (J=5%, K=10%, M=20%)] - Second line: rated DC voltage [and code for the dielectric material] For a ceramic capacitor, often only a three-digit code is given. The first two digits correspond to the first two digits of the value whilst the third digit is a multiplier which gives the number of zeros to be added to give the value in pF. For example, 104 means 10 x 104 pF = 100nF. Furthermore, some capacitors such as electrolytic capacitors are marked with symbols (\u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d) to indicate the correct polarity. Failure to observe these markings when connecting a capacitor to a circuit can be catastrophic!
