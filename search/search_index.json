An instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is connected to a circuit. The power supply must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit. Description Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), Kirchhoff's first law, or Kirchhoff's junction rule, states that, for any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node; or equivalently: the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero: \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} {{V_k} \\over {R_k}} = 0 Figure B.1 The current entering any junction is equal to the current leaving that junction. i_2 + i_3 = i_1 + i_4 Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), Kirchhoff's second law, or Kirchhoff's loop rule, states the following: The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero. \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{n} V_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} {{i} {R_k}} = 0 where i is the loop current.

Sketch the breadboard below onto your notebook then draw how the components will be connected to the breadboard according to the circuit shown in Step 3. Clearly show which tie point will the wire, resistor and power supply be attached to. Repeat the previous step for as many times as required to sketch the breadboard connection diagram for using the DMMs to measure the votlage across and current through each resistor. Copy the resistance, voltage, and current recording tables found in the lab into your notebook. Procedures In this part of the lab, we will be exploring resistors in parallel and series configurations. Obtain the necessary resistors, a breadboard and a few jumper wires. If a resistor value is not available, use resistors of similar value. Turn on the DMM at your workbench and turn it to the \u201c\u03a9 2W\u201d resistance measurement mode. Measure and record the resistance of each resistor. Lab Question 1: Record the resistance (at least 3 S.F.) of each resistor in the table below: R1 (10k\u03a9) R2 (1k\u03a9) R3 (1k\u03a9) R4 (470\u03a9) R5 (330k\u03a9) Measured Resistance [k\u03a9] Assemble the circuit shown below then measure the following as per the circuit and connection diagram you prepared in the pre-lab: the voltage across and current through R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 REMEMBER: To measure voltage, the digital multimeter needs to be in DC voltage mode (DCV) to act as a voltmeter. A voltmeter needs to be connected in parallel with a resistor to measure the voltage across. REMEMBER: To measure current, the digital multimeter needs to be in DC current mode (DCI) to act as an ammeter. An ammeter needs to be connected in series with a resistor to measure the current.

The number of positive charges and negative charges is usually equal. Neutral objects neither attract nor repel each other electrically. This balance of charge can be upset by rubbing an object against another object further explained in Chapter 5.1 of University Physics Vol 2 or by the presence of another nearby charged object further explained in Chapter 5.2 . In this lab, the attractive and/or repulsive electrostatic force between charged objects will be observed using a setup shown in Figure 1.1. You will confirm the presence of electric charges and the forces exerted by these charges. Figure 1.1 Lab 1 Setup Materials A stand String or fishing line Paper clip Plastic Straw (Polypropylene) Plastic Wrap Wool Cloth Glass Rod Steel Rod Preparation Answer all the lab preparation questions at the end of this document in your lab notebook BEFORE your lab session. Students who did not complete the lab preparation will be asked not to join the lab and receive a grade of ZERO (0) for the lab. Lab preparation must be done individually in the lab notebook. Lab Preparation Question Summarize in your notebook or print out the lab manual for lab 1 as the power in the lab room will NOT be ON for this lab. Copy and fill in the following observation table in your notebook (except for the observation column): Step Object 1 Rubbed with Object 2 Rubbed with Observation (Attract/Repel) 6 Plastic Straw Wool Plastic Straw Wool 8 Plastic Straw Wool 9 Plastic Straw 12 13 What is your hypothesis/prediction on the observation you'll make in steps 12 and 13? Use concepts in Chapter 5.2 in the University Physic Volume 2 textbook to justify your answer. Describe how you can neutralize your hand from electric charges in the lab room using the technique mentioned in the lab manual. Procedures If not enough stands are available, work in groups of 2. All questions in the lab must be answered individually and every member must individually demostrate completion of the lab. Place and secure the stand on the table. Attach a paper clip onto a strong then hang the paper clip about 5cm below the end hook of the stand. The paper clip is used to hold a plastic straw. Carefully secure a plastic straw onto the paper clip so it evenly sits on the paper clip and it's free to rotate on the stand. NOTE: In some instant, it might be beneficial to hang the stand off the side of the table to allow full rotation of the straw once it's attached to the paper clip. Technique and attention to detail is the key to this lab and in any of your future lab. Remove the plastic straw from the paper clip then rub both ends of a plastic straw with the wool cloth. ONLY handle the middle of the straw as handling the ends you've charged will alter its charge. Once charged, carefully suspend the plastic straw from the stand using the paper clip. ONLY handle the middle of the straw. What you've done is charging the plastic straw NEGATIVELY (free electron from the wool cloth is transferred onto the surface of the plastic straw). Next, rub one end of a second plastic straw in the same way then hold it close to the first plastic straw (without touching) . Remember, do not hold the straw on the side that you've charged. Observe the (attractive or repulsive) force exerted on the first plastic straw suspended from the stand. Lab Question 1: What interaction between the straws do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Which law have you confirmed? Explain your answer by specifying the charge in each plastic straw. Ensure your hand is not charged by placing your palm on the metal surface or the rubber mat on the workbench. Then discharge the second plastic straw by slowly touching it (not rubbing) with your hand then neutralize your hand. Repeat this a few times until the second straw no longer exerts any force on the first straw. Note: Technique is critical. You should often discharge yourself by placing your palm on the metal surface or the rubber mat of the workbench. We can assume they are connected to the ground (earth) and are electrically neutral. Recharge the second (now neutral) plastic straw by rubbing it with the plastic wrap. Hold it close to the first wool-charged plastic straw and observe the nature of the force. Lab Question 2: What interaction between the straws do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Use your observation to predict what type of charge is on plastic wrap-rubbed straw (positive or negative). ie. Did the plastic wrap-rubbed straw gain/lose electrons? Remember: It was previously given that the wool-rubbed straw is charged negatively. Discharge the second plastic straw. Take a glass rod and charge it using the wool cloth. Hold it close to the first wool-charged plastic straw. WARNING! The glass rod is fragile! Handle with care! Lab Question 3: What interaction between the straw and the rod do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Use your observation to predict what type of charge is on the wool-rubbed glass rod (positive or negative). ie. Did the wool-rubbed glass rod gain/lose electrons? Discharge the glass rod. WARNING! The glass rod is fragile! Handle with care! Lab Question 4: From the result of questions 1 to 3, which materials (plastic straw, wool, plastic wrap, glass rod) do you think will most likely gain electrons and which will most likely lose electrons? For example: We defined the straw as negatively charged when rubbed with wool. Therefore, the straw is more likely to gain electrons than the wool. The steps above demonstrate the triboelectric effects and electrostatic force between two charged objects. In the next steps, you will observe the force between a charged object and a neutral object. Touch a metal surface on the workbench to ensure your hand is not charged. Discharge the plastic straw on the stand and a glass rod with your hand until there is no electrostatic force between them when holding them near one another. Leaving the plastic straw neutral, charge the glass rob with the wool cloth. Hold the glass rod close to the plastic straw. Lab Question 5: What interaction between the rod and the straw do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Why is the neutral plastic straw attracted to the glass rob? Explain the phenomenon and discuss how this can draw you to the wrong conclusion regarding the charge on each object. Refer to Chapter 5.2 in the University Physic Volume 2 textbook if required. The steps above demonstrate transferring of charges on the surface of insulators. In the next step, you will observe what will happen when charging a conducting object. Leaving the neutral plastic straw suspended. Rub one end of a steel rod with the wool cloth then hold it near the neutral plastic straw. Lab Question 6: What interaction between the rod and the straw do you observe? Write it down into the observation table you created in the pre-lab. Explain the phenomenon. Refer to Chapter 5.2 in the University Physic Volume 2 textbook if required. Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate you've completed the lab and written down all your observation. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab. Post-Lab Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the post-lab question(s) on blackboard.

Only the plastic rod and wood dowel can be carefully suspended (and balanced) using the paper clip. Lab Preparation Question Design an experiment to develop a triboelectric series similar to Lab 1 . Your experiment should be a series of tests that use soft materials to charge hard objects and then observe if the hard objects attract or repel. You'll also need to use logical reasoning (similar to a Seduko puzzle) to draw your conclusion. Copy the following observation table in your notebook.

Add more tests to the table above as necessary. One approach is to test all possible combinations but keep in mind that only a soft material can rub a hard object. Read the following cases to understand the logic: Case 1: Plastic Wrap If Material-A is rubbed with Plastic Wrap, Material-A is positively charged (lose electrons) because the Plastic Wrap is more negative (gain electrons). Case 2: If Material-A rubbed with Material-B is attracted to Material-C rubbed with Material-B, then we know the charge on Material-A is opposite to the charge on Material-C. However, to determine which one is positively charged and which on is negatively charged, we must know the properties of Material-B relative to Material-A and Material-C. As a result, always start your experiment with the known material (Plastic Wrap). Procedures If not enough stands are available, work in groups of 2. All questions in the lab must be answered individually and every member must individually demostrate completion of the lab. Place and secure the stand on the table.

An instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is connected to a circuit. The power supply must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit. Description Digital Multimeter (DMM) A multimeter is a measuring instrument that can measure multiple electrical properties. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, resistance, and current. However, some multimeters, such as the one in the electronics lab, can also measure capacitance. Digital multimeters (DMM) have numeric displays and have made analog multimeters obsolete as they are cheaper, more precise, and more physically robust than analog multimeters.

Students who did not complete the lab preparation will be asked not to join the lab and receive a grade of ZERO (0) for the lab. Lab preparation must be done individually in the lab notebook. Lab Preparation Question: Copy the following observation table in your notebook for this lab: Output: +1V Output: +2V Output: +5V Output: +10V Range: 100mV Range: 1V Range: 10V Range: 100V Range: 1000V Research: beside voltage, resistance, and current, list two other electronics-related properties a modem DMM can measure. In your own word, explain the difference between the two ON/OFF settings of the DC power supply we use in this lab. Procedures Part 1: Safety Ensure that you are wearing your safety glasses, not wearing open-toe shoes, and any long hair must be tied-up. At the top of your workbench, you\u2019ll see a red \u201cEmergency Stop\u201d button (shown in Figure 3.3). At any time when the button is in the pressed position, your workbench will be disconnected from the power source. Press this button if there are any issues with your equipment or circuit (such as unusual heat, unusual smell, smoke, spark, or fire). To release the button, twist it as per the symbol on the button and the button will no longer be pressed. Figure 3.3 Emergency Stop Button Ensure the Emergency Stop button is in the released position. Part 2: Digital Multimeter (DMM) and DC Voltage Measurement Identify the digital multimeter (DMM) at your workbench. If there are two DMMs, use the one on the left-hand side. Disconnect any cables that are plugged in it so the DMM is as shown in Figure 3.4 below. Figure 3.4 Set the DMM to DC voltage measurement mode as follows: If the DMM is not already powered on, push the power button (1). Once the DMM is ON, push the DC voltage (DCV) measurement mode button (4). If the \u201cRange\u201d indicator (3) is not showing \u201cAuto\u201d, press the menu button under \u201cRange\u201d (2) and change it to \u201cAuto\u201d. Identify the two cables that are next to the DMM with a banana connector on one end and an alligator clip on the other end. Connect the banana connector from the red cable to the red terminal labelled with \u201cHI\u201d under \u201cInput V\u03a9\u25ba|\u201d (5). Connect the banana connector from the black cable to the black terminal labelled with \u201cLO\u201d under \u201cInput V\u03a9\u25ba|\u201d (6) Figure 3.5 Verify the cables are connected as per shown in Figure 3.5 above. At this point, your DMM is set up to measure direct current (DC) voltage. We\u2019ll be discussing direct current voltage during class. Remember this configuration for future labs and careers as measuring DC voltage is a very important skill for working with electronics. Identify the DC power supply at your workbench. If there are two DC power supplies, use the one on the left-hand side. Disconnect any cables that are plugged in so it is as shown in Figure 3.6 below. Figure 3.6 Turn on the DC power supply (1) and then press the \u201cDisplay Limit\u201d button (2). Select the appropriate output voltage range (10) and use the lowest possible setting for a 5V output. In Figure 3.6 above, the lowest setting is \"15V, 7A\", however, the lowest output range varies between different models of power supply. Adjust the voltage output to +5.000V (9) using the digit selector (6) and the adjustment knob (7). Depending on the model of the power supply, the number of significant figures of the voltage output might be different. Identify the black cable with two leads that are next to the DC power supply with a banana connector on one end and an alligator clip on the other end. Connect the red banana connector from the cable to the red \u201cOutput\u201d terminal labelled with \u201c+\u201d (9) NOTE: In some models of power supply, there might be multiple output terminals. connect to the appropriate output terminal depending on the output range you selected earlier. Connect the black banana connector from the cable to the black \u201cOutput\u201d terminal labelled with \u201c-\u201c (10) You\u2019ve now set up the power supply for DC output. Connect the two red alligator clips (one from the DMM and one from the power supply) and connect the two black alligator clips as shown in Figure 3.7. Figure 3.7 WARNING: Ensure the exposed portion of the red alligator clip is NOT touching the exposed portion of the black alligator clip. Your setup should look like Figure 3.8 below. The second DMM, oscilloscope, and function can be in the OFF state. Figure 3.8 Press the \"Display Limit\" button (2) on the power supply again and verify the voltage is adjusted to +5.000V and the banana cables are connected. Also, verify that the exposed portion of the red alligator clip is NOT touching the exposed portion of the black alligator clip. Turn on the power supply output by pressing the Output On/Off button (8). NOTE: There is a difference between the power supply being ON/OF and the power supply OUTPUT being ON/OFF. The power supply can be ON with its power output OFF. Notice that the DMM should now read about +5V, similar to as shown in Figure 3.9. Make a note of the range value beside the \u201cAuto\u201d on the DMM display. Figure 3.9 With the power supply output ON, adjust the output voltage to +13V. Note: If the output range does not allow you to go to 13V, switch the output range (10) and terminals as necessary. Lab Question 1: What happened to the Range setting on the DMM? If you don't notice the change, decrease the output voltage back to 5V and try again. Afterward, decrease the voltage of the DC power supply slowly to 5V. Lab Question 2: At what power supply voltage did the DMM change back \u201cAuto 10V\u201d? How are the number of digits and decimal places the same or different when the voltage range changes? What does that mean for the precision of the readings? Using the DMM reading only, adjust the output voltage of the DC power supply so the reading on the DMM will display +1.000V. Note: Switch the output range and terminal as necessary. Lab Question 3: What is the output voltage of the DC power supply? Do they agree exactly with each other? If not, which one is higher and what is the percentage difference? Adjust the DC power supply output voltage to +1.000V then change the voltage Range on the DMM from \"Auto\" to \"100mV\" using the Range selection button. The DMM should not display \"OVERLOAD\" because the 1V output from the power supply is higher than the maximum 100mV range that can be measured. Manually change the DMM \"Range\" setting and power supply voltage output according to the table below. Then record the voltage reading on the DMM in the and do this for DC output voltage of +1V, +2V, +5V, and +10V. NOTE: The reading might fluctuate but record at least 4 significant digits to the best of your ability in estimating AND record all LEADING ZEROS . Output: +1V Output: +2V Output: +5V Output: +10V Range: 100mV OVERLOAD Range: 1V Range: 10V Range: 100V Range: 1000V Lab Question 4: If we want the most precise reading, what is the best setting for each DC output voltage in the table? Circle the most precise reading for each voltage output in the table above. Turn off the DC power supply and disconnect the alligator clips. Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate you've completed the lab and written down all your observation. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab. Post-Lab Using the skills and knowledge acquired from this lab, answer the post-lab question(s) on blackboard.

An instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is connected to a circuit. The power supply must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit. Description Direct current (DC) is the one-directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC).

In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.

Preparation Lab Preparation Question: Sketch the breadboard below onto your notebook then draw how the components will be connected to the breadboard according to the circuit shown in Step 10. Clearly show which tie point will the wire, resistor, DMM, and power supply be attached to. Example: Note how the tie-points are connected together by the straight lines. TinkerCAD Circuit is a nice tool that you can use to practice assembling a circuit with a virtual breadboard. See the diagram below as an example. Copy two (2x) of the following Table 1 into your notebook for this lab: Table 1: Resistor # First Band Second Band Multiplier Nonimal \u03a9 Measured \u03a9 Colour Total Value x 10 ^ If the voltage source in Step 10 is 5V and R1 is 1k\u03a9, calculate the current of the circuit. Repeat the calculation above for a 10k\u03a9 resistor. Copy the following Table 2 into your notebook for this lab: Table 2: Measured Voltage Measured Current Calculated Resistance Resistor #1 Resistor #2 Procedures Obtain a 1k\u03a9 resistor, a 10k\u03a9 resistor, a breadboard and a few jumper wires. If the resistor value is not available, use resistors of similar value. Lab Question 1: Write down the colour code of each resistor then determine their resistance value using the resistor colour chart. Use the table below to help you determine the resistance value of each resistor. Fill in the \"Measured \u03a9\" in the next step. Example: Resistor # First Band Second Band Multiplier Nonimal \u03a9 Measured \u03a9 Colour Brown Black Red Total Value 1 0 x 10 ^ 2 1 k\u03a9 1.013 k\u03a9 Turn on the one of DMM at your workbench and turn it into the \u201c\u03a9 2W\u201d resistance measurement mode. Connect the red alligator clip of the DMM to one lead of one of the resistors and the black alligator clip to the other lead of the resistor. Lab Question 2: Write down the measured resistance (at least 3 significant figures) in the \"Measured \u03a9\" column of the table you created in the pre-lab. Does this value agree with the colour band value? What is the % error? Is the error within the tolerance of the resistor (indicated by the tolerance band)? Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the second resistor then disconnect the DMM from the resistor. Place the breadboard on the workbench and ensure one jumper wire (any colour) is connected to the \u201cVa\u201d banana post and one jumper wire (any colour) is connected to the \u201cGND\u201d banana post. Figure 4.5 Ensure the DC power supply is OFF. Locate the cable from the DC power supply. Clip the red alligator clip to the red banana post and the black alligator clip to the black banana post. Figure 4.6 Set up one of the DMM for voltage measurement (Review Lab 2 for procedure). Connect one jumper cable to each of the alligator clips then connect the black wire with its jumper wire to the blue (-) rail and the red wire with its jumper wire to the red (+) rail of the breadboard. Figure 4.7 Turn on the DC power supply and set the output to 5V then turn on the output. Verify the voltage reading on the DMM agrees with the output of the DC power supply then turn it off . If you are not seeing 5VDC at the DMM, verify your wiring and that you are using the correct output channel of the power supply. Next, we\u2019ll set up a second DMM for the current measurement. For this, we\u2019ll connect the black banana cable to the \u201cLO\u201d Input (3) and the red banana cable to the \u201c3A\u201d Input (4). Afterward, press the \u201cSHIFT\u201d button (1) and the \u201cDCV\u201d button (2) together to enter DC current mode (DCI). Figure 4.8 Once the DMM is in DC current mode, connect a jumper wire to each of the DMM\u2019s alligator clips. Figure 4.9 Next, we\u2019ll assemble the following circuit using the breadboard and one of the resistors from earlier. A power supply will act as the DC Voltage Source. Notice the voltmeter (DMM in DC voltage mode (DCV)) is connected in parallel with the resistor and the Ammeter (DMM in DC current mode (DCI)) is connected in series with the circuit. A small example of some of the connections is shown. Figure 4.10 Double-verify that the circuit is assembled properly and that there is no short circuit. Tips: Follow the flow of current from the positive (+) terminal of the power supply to the resistor, then to the ammeter, then to the negative terminal of the power supply to verify proper connections. Turn on the output of the power supply and ensure the output is at 5V. Lab Question 3: What value do you see on the voltmeter (DMM in DC voltage mode) and the Ammeter (DMM in DC current mode)? Record the measured voltage and measured current in Table 2 then use Ohm\u2019s law to calculate the resistance. Does the calculated resistance agree more with the resistance value provided by the manufacturer or with the resistance you measured earlier? Repeat steps 10-12 for the second resistor. Turn off the DC power supply. Disconnect the resistors from the breadboard and the voltmeter from its jumper wire.

Description A capacitor is an electronic device for storing electrical energy, consisting of two conductors in close proximity and insulated from each other. A simple example of such a storage device is the parallel-plate capacitor. If positive charges with total charge +Q are deposited on one of the conductors and an equal amount of negative charge \u2212Q is deposited on the second conductor, the capacitor is said to have a charge Q.

Turn on a DMM and set it to capacitance mode by pressing the SHIFT (1) + Freq (2) button (to access the -||- mode).

Figure 5.2 Lab Question 1: Record the capacitance with the alligator clip not connected to anything. This is the capacitance due to just the cable. Obtain two pieces of aluminum foil of about 20cm x 20xm in size and obtain several sheets of paper that are larger than the aluminum foil. Record the size of each aluminum foil. Lab Question 2: Record the size of the capacitor. Tape each aluminum foil to a piece of paper with the corners not taped for an alligator clip connection. Figure 5.3 Connect the red alligator clip from the DMM to one corner of the first aluminum foil and the black alligator clip to another corner of the second aluminum foil as shown in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4 Arrange the aluminum foil and papers as per the figure below to create a parallel plate capacitor. Use a flat weight (ie. a textbook) to keep the capacitor in place. NOTE: It is very important to ensure the two aluminum foils are not touching and isolated by the paper. Also, ensure the aluminum foils and papers stack is as close to each other as possible with no air gap in between. Record the capacitance then repeat the test for other thicknesses by increasing the number of sheets of paper in between the aluminum foil. Increment in multiple of 3-5 sheets. Each sheet of 20lbs paper is about 0.097mm. NOTE: It is important to ensure the weight apply and its application is the same throughout the entire experiment. Also, as the weight settles onto the aluminum foils and papers stack, it will continuously press the parallel foils closer. Just choose a consistent settling time for each step when recording the capacitance value because we cannot wait until the weight completely settles. Conduct at least 10 trials of various thicknesses or until a change in capacitance can no longer be observed. Lab Question 3: Record your observation in the table below.

Plot your results (Capacitance along the y-axis and separation distance along the x-axis) then draw the trend line. This can be done by hand or software. Hint: It's not a linear relationship. Lab Question 5 (Post-Lab): Calculate the coefficient for the trend line. Does it agree with the theoretical value of \\epsilon_0 ? Explain why you think it is the same or not the same as the theoretical (other than human measurement error). Disconnect the DMM and return the aluminum foil once you are done.

Record the capacitance then repeat the test for other thicknesses by increasing the number of sheets of paper in between the aluminum foil. Increment in multiple of 3-5 sheets. Each sheet of 20lbs paper is about 0.097mm. NOTE: It is important to ensure the weight apply and its application is the same throughout the entire experiment. Also, as the weight settles onto the aluminum foils and papers stack, it will continuously press the parallel foils closer. Just choose a consistent settling time for each step when recording the capacitance value because we cannot wait until the weight completely settles. Conduct at least 10 trials of various thicknesses or until a change in capacitance can no longer be observed. Lab Question 3: Record your observation in the table below. Foil Capacitance = Measured Capacitance - Cable Capacitance, C_{foil} = C_{total} - C_{cable} . Trial # of seperating sheet Separation (mm) Measured C [nF] Foil C [nF] 1 ... Note: The capacitor setup already has one sheet as a separation Lab Question 4 (Post-Lab): Using the area of the aluminum foils you measured and the separation distance of each step from your experiment into the relationship. Plot your results (Capacitance along the y-axis and separation distance along the x-axis) then draw the trend line. This can be done by hand or software. Hint: It's not a linear relationship. Lab Question 5 (Post-Lab): Calculate the coefficient for the trend line. Does it agree with the theoretical value of \\epsilon_0 ? Explain why you think it is the same or not the same as the theoretical (other than human measurement error). Disconnect the DMM and return the aluminum foil once you are done.","title":"Part 1: Parallel Plate Capacitor"},{"location":"ses250/lab5/#part-2-resistors-in-parallel-and-in-series","text":"In this part of the lab, we will be exploring resistors in parallel and series configurations. Obtain a 1k\u03a9 resistor, two 10k\u03a9 resistors, a breadboard and a few jumper wires. If the resistor value is not available, use resistors of similar value. Turn on the DMM at your workbench and turn it to the \u201c\u03a9 2W\u201d resistance measurement mode. Measure and record the resistance of each resistor. Lab Question 6: Record the resistance (at least 3 S.F.) of each resistor in the table below: R1 (1k\u03a9) R2 (10k\u03a9) R3 (10k\u03a9) Measured Resistance [k\u03a9] Assemble the circuit shown below then measure the resistance between node A and node B. Figure 5.5 Lab Question 6: Does the measured resistance agree with the value you calculated in the pre-lab? What is the percentage error? Is it within the tolerance of the resistor? Assemble the circuit shown below then measure the following as per the circuit and connection diagram you prepared in the pre-lab: the voltage between node A and node B the current through R1, R2, R3 Figure 5.6 Lab Question 7: Record the measured values in the table below. Voltage A-B ( V_{AB} ) Current of R1 ( I_1 ) Current of R1 ( I_2 ) Current of R1 ( I_3 ) Measured Value Lab Question 8: Does the measured value agree with the value you calculated in the pre-lab? What is the percentage error? Is it within the tolerance of the resistor?
