## Introduction

In this project, you will demonstrate your achievement in setting up a ROS1 environment and creating a simple node to control a robot using Gazebo.

## Objectives

1. Set up the Gazebo environment to work with ROS.
2. Create a simple ROS node to control a robot in Gazebo.
3. Answer assessment questions.

**NOTE:** This project must be completed individually.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Gazebo Environment

1. Install Gazebo as per the [Lab 4](lab4.md) instructions.
2. Create your new ROS workspace (or use the same one) as per the [Lab 3](lab3.md) instructions.

### Step 2: Create and Run a Simple ROS Node

Use open-source code, AI-generated code, or your own code to create a control script as described below to make the JetAuto robot move according to a pattern in Gazebo.

Write code that will move the JetAuto robot in a roughly 1-meter square shape pattern as follows:

![Figure 1 Square Movement Pattern](lab4-task.png)

***Figure 1** Square Movement Pattern*

Start:

1. Move from (0, 0, 0°) to (1, 0, 0°) facing the direction of travel; then
2. Move from (1, 0, 0°) to (1, 1, 0°) without turning, so the robot is facing the outside of the square; then
3. Turn from (1, 1, 0°) to (1, 1, -90°) to face into the square.
4. Move from (1, 1, -90°) to (0, 1, -90°) facing the inside of the square.
5. Move from (0, 1, -90°) to (0, 0, 0°) by rotating the robot while traveling.

Repeat this 2 times after a start command (such as a keyboard input) is given.

For example: after launching the JetAuto in Gazebo, when you run `rosrun lab4_jetauto_control jetauto_control`, it will ask for input before performing the above action.

**Hint:** You can follow the same approach as Lab 3 by creating a new package called `lab4_jetauto_control` in your `ros_ws`.

        catkin_create_pkg lab4_jetauto_control rospy geometry_msgs

Refer to the `teleop_key_control.py` controller you used in [lab4](lab4.md) on how to publish to the JetAuto nodes.

## Assessment Questions

1. What command did you use to launch the JetAuto robot in Gazebo?
2. Which two other launch files were called when you launched `worlds.launch`? **Hint:** Inspect the launch files in `jetauto_ws/src/jetauto_simulation/jetauto_gazebo/launch`.
3. Describe the process of setting up the ROS workspace and creating the package.
4. How do you estimate that the robot moved roughly 1 meter in each of the steps?
5. What challenges did you face with making the robot move in a straight line while turning, and how did you overcome them?

## Submission

1. A link to your project folder (e.g., on GitHub (private) or Google Drive) containing all the necessary files and code.
2. A video showing your code running in Gazebo and the robot moving.
3. A text file containing the answers to the questions for every group member.

### Late Submission Penalty

1. A 25% reduction from the full mark will be applied for every 24 hours the submission is late after the deadline.
