## Description

If you don't remember how to operate the DMM and read the resistor colour band, refer to the description section of [Lab 2](lab2.md).

### Voltage Measurement

In Lab 2, we used the DMM as a voltmeter to measure voltage (or the potential difference) across two nodes in a circuit. When measuring voltage, the DMM is connected in **_parallel_** with the circuit as shown in Figure 2.14a from [Lab 2](lab2.md). An ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance so energy will not be dissipated by the test equipment. In practice, the internal resistance of a voltmeter is in the MΩ range.

### Current Measurement

Most modern DMMs are capable of being used as an ammeter for measuring current through a circuit. Differing from voltage measurement, current measurement is made by connecting the DMM is **_series_** with the circuit as shown in Figure 3.1. An ideal ammeter has zero resistance so energy will not be dissipated by the test equipment. In practice, the internal resistance of a voltmeter is in the Ω range.

### Resistance Measurement

Most modern DMMs are also capable of measuring the resistance through a circuit. This feature, however, is most often used to measure the resistance of a single resistor. To measure resistance, put the DMM in resistance measuring mode then connect the DMM in **_parallel_** with the circuit.

### TinkerCAD Breadboard Simulator

There are many breadboard simulators available online. In particular, [TinkerCAD Circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/) is a nice tool that you can use to practice assembling a circuit with a virtual breadboard. See the diagram below as an example. Use this tool to help you prepare for this and future labs.

## Procedures

### Part 1: Resistance Measurement

1. Take out a 1kΩ resistor and a 10kΩ resistor from your lab kit.

    > **Lab Question 1:** Write down the colour code of each resistor then determine their resistance value using the resistor colour chart in [Lab 2](lab2.md). Use the table below to help you determine the resistance value of each resistor. Leave the "Measured Ω" blank.
    >
    > **Example:**
    >
    > ||1st Band|2nd Band|Multiplier|Nonimal Ω|Measured Ω| % Error |
    > |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    > |Colour|Brown|Black|Red|Total|-|-|
    > |Value|1|0|x 10 ^ 2|1 kΩ|1.013 kΩ|1.3%|

1. Turn on the one of DMM at your workbench and turn it into the “Ω 2W” (1) resistance measurement mode. Ensure the banana plugs are connected to the resistance input terminals as shown in Figure 3.3 (2)(3).

    ![Figure 3.3 DMM Resistance Mode](lab3-dmm-resistance.png)

    ***Figure 3.3* DMM Resistance Mode**

1. Connect the red alligator clip of the DMM to one lead of one of the resistors and the black alligator clip to the other lead of the resistor.

    > **Lab Question 2:** Write down the measured resistance (at least 3 significant figures) in the "Measured Ω" column of the table you created in the pre-lab. Does this value agree with the normal resistor value according to the colour band value? What is the % error? Is the error within the tolerance of the resistor (indicated by the tolerance band)?

1. Repeat step 3 for the second resistor then disconnect the DMM from the resistor.

### Part 2: Voltage and Current Measurement

1. Ensure the DC power supply is OFF. Locate its red and black cables then attach jumper wires to the alligator clips as shown in Figure 2.12 from [Lab 2](lab2.md).

1. Set up one of the DMMs to voltage mode (Refer to [Lab 2](lab2.md) if you don't remember the procedure) and ensure the banana cables are connected properly to the DMM for voltage measure. Connect jumper wires to each of the alligator clips.

1. Set up the other DMM at your workbench to the current mode (DCI) by holding the "SHIFT" button (1) and the "DCV" button (2). Afterward, ensure the banana cable is connected properly to the DMM for voltage measurement by connecting the black banana cable to the "LO" Input (3) and the red banana cable to the "3A" Input (4) as shown in Figure 3.4. Then Connect jumper wires to each of the alligator clips.

    ![Figure 3.4](lab3-dmm-current.png)

    ***Figure 3.4***

1. Next, insert one of the resistors onto a breadboard the same way as shown in Figure 2.9 from [Lab 2](lab2.md) then connect the jumper wires from DMMs and the power supply to form the following circuit. Notice the voltmeter (DMM in DC voltage mode (DCV)) is connected in parallel with the resistor and the Ammeter (DMM in DC current mode (DCI)) is connected in series with the circuit. A small example of some of the connections is shown.

    ![Figure 3.5a](lab3-voltage-current-circuit.png)

    ![Figure 3.5b](lab3-connection-1.png)

    ***Figure 3.5***

1. Double-verify that the circuit is assembled properly and that there is no short circuit. **Tips:** Follow the flow of the current on your physical circuit from the positive (+) terminal of the power supply to the resistor, then to the ammeter, then to the negative terminal of the power supply to verify proper connections.

1. Turn on the DC power supply and set the output to 5V then turn on the output. Verify the voltage reading on the DMM agrees with the output of the DC power supply then **turn it off**. If you are not seeing 5VDC at the DMM, verify your wiring and that you are using the correct output channel of the power supply. 

    >
    > **Lab Question 3:** Adjust the power supply output to 1V, 2V, 5V, and 10V to complete the table below. Do the measurements agree with Ohm's Law?
    >
    > |Power Supply Voltage [V]|1V|2V|5V|10V|
    > |---|---|---|---|---|
    > |Current Using 1kΩ Resistor [A]|||||
    > |Current Using 10kΩ Resistor [A]|||||

1. Turn off the DC power supply output.

    ![Figure 3.6](lab3-series-circuit.png)

    ***Figure 3.6***

1. Set the DC power supply to 1V output then turn on the output. Verify the voltage reading on the DMM agrees with the output of the DC power supply then **turn it off**. If you are not seeing 1VDC at the DMM, verify your wiring and that you are using the correct output channel of the power supply. 

    >
    > **Lab Question 4:** Adjust the power supply output to 1V, 2V, 5V, and 10V to complete the table below. Do the measurements agree with the estimate you made in the pre-lab?
