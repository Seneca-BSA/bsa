## Objectives
- Master the use of fundamental laboratory equipment
- Master the basic techniques of conducting experiments and taking measurement
- Experimentally verify the theory and concept studied in lectures

## Materials/Equipment required by each student
- Safety Glasses
- Bound Notebook

## Each student is expected to
1. Maintain a **bound** (ie. No loose sheets) laboratory/engineering notebook. The notebook shall include all preparations work and documentation of all work done during the laboratory. You are not required to have a new notebook. You can continue using one you already have or share it with another course.
    - Always write in pen, never in pencil, and never use white-out in the notebook. If a mistake needs to be corrected, it shall be neatly crossed out with a single line and corrections shall be added.
    - Always prepare for the laboratory experiment by writing a brief description of the experimental procedures in your own words and copying any graphs and tables to be used for documentation during the experiment into the notebook.
    - Update the notebook continually during each experiment and include all measured data, tables, graphs, and details of relevant measurement techniques, computations, and conclusions.

1. Arrive on time and be well-prepared for each laboratory session. A complete preparation includes, aside from a description of the procedures, the completion of the preparatory assignment for the experiment.
1. Finish all parts of the experiment on time. Thorough preparatory work is critical.

## Laboratory Code of Behavior
1. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and safe manner at all times.
