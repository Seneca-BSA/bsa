## Objectives:
- To compare the electrostatic properties of various insulating and conducting materials
- To be familiar with scientific experimental techniques

## Purpose
- Perform qualitative observation between various charged materials
- Categorization of materials based on the triboelectric effect

## Description

>"The triboelectric series ranks various materials according to their tendency to gain or lose electrons, which reflects the natural physical property of materials. Static electricity occurs when there is an excess of positive or negative charges on an objectâ€™s surface by rubbing certain materials together. The position of the material in the triboelectric series determines how effectively the charges will be exchanged. Normally, the build-up of static electricity would be undesirable because it can result in product failure or a serious safety hazard11,12 caused by electrostatic discharge and/or electrostatic attraction. This series can be used to select materials that will minimize static charging to prevent the electrostatic discharge or electrostatic attraction."

In this lab, similar to [Lab 1](lab1.md), the attractive and/or repulsive electrostatic force between charged objects will be observed using a setup shown in Figure 2.1.

***Figure 2.1** Lab 2 Setup*

You will build on top of the observation you made and expand your experiment to eight materials and rank them into a triboelectric series.

## Materials
- A stand
- String or fishing line
- Paper clip
- Plastic Straw (Polypropylene)
- Plastic Wrap
- Wool Cloth
- Glass Rod
- Wooden Rod / Dowel
- Silk Cloth
- Cotton Cloth
- Plastic Rod (Acrylic)

## Preparation

Study the lab description and procedure then answer all the lab preparation questions at the end of this document in your lab notebook BEFORE your lab session.

There are a total of eight materials available to you in this lab. Only the plastic straw can be suspended from the stand.

> **Lab Preparation Question:**
>
> Design an experiment in terms of having one object rubbed with a softer material to expand your list (triboelectric series) from [Lab 1](lab1.md).
>
> In [Lab 1](lab1.md), it was defined that when the plastic straw is rubbed with wool, the wool loses electrons and the plastic straw gains electrons. To help you get started, out of all the materials available in this Lab, glass is the most positive in the triboelectric series. Therefore, we can place them on our triboelectric series as such:
>>
>> **More Positive (more likely to lose electrons)**
>> 
>> Glass
>> 
>> ...
>> 
>> Wool
>> 
>> ...
>>
>> Plastic Straw
>> 
>> ...
>> 
>> **More Negative (more likely to gain electrons)**
>>
> Your task is to determine where Plastic Wrap, Wooden Dowel, Silk, Cotton, and Plastic Rod (Acrylic) fall into the triboelectric series. Design a series of tests to systematically determine the relative triboelectric position of each material. 
>
> **For example:**
> 
> **Case 1:** If Plastic Straw rubbed by Wool attract with Plastic Straw rubbed by Material-A, then we know the Plastic Straw rubbed by Material-A is positively charged meaning that Material-A is more negative in the triboelectric series.
>
> **Case 2:** If Plastic Straw rubbed by Wool attract with Material-B rubbed by Wool, then we know Material-B rubbed by Wool is positively charged meaning that Material-B is more positive in the triboelectric series.
>
> Copy the table below with your planned steps into your notebook and use it to record your observation. Add more material pairs to the table as you see fit. Object 1 can be assumed to be the suspended object.
>
>    |Test|Object 1|Rubbed with|Object 2|Rubbed with|Observation|Conclusion|
>    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
>    |1|Plastic Straw|Wool|Plastic Straw|Plastic Wrap|||
>    |2|Plastic Straw||||||
>    |3|Plastic Straw||||||
>    |4|Plastic Straw||||||
>    |...|||||||

## Procedures

1. If not enough stands are available, work in groups of 2. All questions in the lab must be answered individually and every member must individually demostrate completion of the lab.
1. Place and secure the stand on the table. Attach a paper clip onto a strong then hang the paper clip about 5cm below the end hook of the stand. The paper clip is used to hold a plastic straw.
1. Carefully secure a plastic straw onto the paper clip so it evenly sits on the paper clip and it's free to rotate on the stand.
    
    **NOTE:** In some instant, it might be beneficial to hang the stand off the side of the table to allow full rotation of the straw once it's attached to the paper clip.

1. Technique and attention to detail is the key to this lab and in any of your future lab. Remove the plastic straw from the paper clip then rub both ends of a plastic straw with the wool cloth. ONLY handle the middle of the straw as handling the ends you've charged will alter its charge.

1. Perform the procedure(s) you've defined in your pre-lab.

Once you've completed all the above steps, ask the lab professor or instructor over and demostrate you've completed the lab and your observation. You might be asked to explain some of the concepts you've learned in this lab.
