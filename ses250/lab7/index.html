<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<h3 id="capacitor">Capacitor</h3>
<p>A capacitor is an electronic device for storing electrical energy, consisting of two conductors in close proximity and insulated from each other. A simple example of such a storage device is the parallel-plate capacitor. If positive charges with total charge +Q are deposited on one of the conductors and an equal amount of negative charge −Q is deposited on the second conductor, the capacitor is said to have a charge Q.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/capacitor">Britannica: capacitor</a></p>
<p>The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor can be calculated using:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> C = {{\epsilon_0 A} \over {s}} </script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex">\epsilon_0</script> is the permittivity in vacuum and have a value of <script type="math/tex">\epsilon_0 = {8.854 \times 10^{-12} {Nm^2 \over C^2}}</script>, <script type="math/tex">A</script> is the area of the plates, and <script type="math/tex">s</script> is the distance between the plates.</p>
<p>Similar to resistors, capacitors use special markings to indicate their values. Since the amount of area for markings on a capacitor is limited, there are also a set of rules for specifying the capacitance value of a capacitor. Manufacturers often use two separate lines for their capacitor markings and these have the following meanings:
- First line: capacitance (in pF or μF) [and tolerance (J=5%, K=10%, M=20%)]
- Second line: rated DC voltage [and code for the dielectric material]</p>
<p>For a ceramic capacitor, often only a three-digit code is given. The first two digits correspond to the first two digits of the value whilst the third digit is a multiplier which gives the number of zeros to be added to give the value in pF. For example, 104 means 10 x 104 pF = 100nF.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some capacitors such as electrolytic capacitors are marked with symbols (“+” and “-”) to indicate the correct polarity - failure to observe these markings when connecting a capacitor to a circuit can be catastrophic!</p>

<h3 id="rc-circuit">RC Circuit</h3>
<p>A resistor-capacitor circuit (RC circuit), RC filter or RC network, is an electric circuit composed of resistors and capacitors. It may be driven by a voltage or current source and these will produce different responses. A first-order RC circuit is composed of one resistor and one capacitor and is the simplest type of RC circuit.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.2" src="../lab7-rc-circuit.png" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 7.2 Series RC circuit</em></strong></p>
<p>A series RC circuit with a capacitor that is initially charged to <script type="math/tex">V_0 = {Q_0 \over C}</script> and then allowed to discharge through a resistor <script type="math/tex">R</script> will exhibit the following relationship for the voltage across the capacitor over some time:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> V_C(t) = V_0 e^{(-{t \over {RC}})} </script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex">V_0</script> is the capacitor voltage at <script type="math/tex">t = 0</script>
</p>
<p>The time required for the voltage to fall to <script type="math/tex">V_0 \over e</script> or about 37% or 1/3 of <script type="math/tex">V_0</script> is called the RC time constant and is given by:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \tau = RC </script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex">\tau</script> is measured in seconds, <script type="math/tex">R</script> in ohms and <script type="math/tex">C</script> in farads.</p>
<p>The chart below shows a typical curve of the voltage across the capacitor during discharge in an RC circuit.</p>

<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="part-1-capacitance-measurement">Part 1: Capacitance Measurement</h3>
<p>In this part of the lab, we will be exploring the capacitance of a capacitor.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn on a DMM and set it to capacitance mode by pressing the SHIFT (1) + Freq (2) button (to access the -||- mode). Ensure the alligator clips are connected to the terminals labelled “HI” under “Input VΩ►|” (3) and “LO” under “Input VΩ►|” (4).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.4" src="lab7-dmm-capacitance.png" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 5.2</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lab Question 1:</strong> Record the capacitance with the alligator clip not connected to anything. This is the capacitance due to just the cable.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain two pieces of aluminum foil of about 20cm x 20xm in size and obtain several sheets of paper that are larger than the aluminum foil. Record the size of each aluminum foil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lab Question 2:</strong> Record the size of the capacitor.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tape each aluminum foil to a piece of paper with the corners not taped for an alligator clip connection.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.3" src="lab5-capacitor-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 5.3</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the red alligator clip from the DMM to one corner of the first aluminum foil and the black alligator clip to another corner of the second aluminum foil as shown in Figure 5.4.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.4" src="lab5-capacitor-2.png" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 5.4</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrange the aluminum foil and papers as per the figure below to create a parallel plate capacitor. Use a flat weight (ie. a textbook) to keep the capacitor in place.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is very important to ensure the two aluminum foils are not touching and isolated by the paper. Also, ensure the aluminum foils and papers stack is as close to each other as possible with no air gap in between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record the capacitance then repeat the test for other thicknesses by increasing the number of sheets of paper in between the aluminum foil. Increment in multiple of 3-5 sheets. Each sheet of 20lbs paper is about 0.097mm.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: It is important to ensure the weight apply and its application is the same throughout the entire experiment. Also, as the weight settles onto the aluminum foils and papers stack, it will continuously press the parallel foils closer. Just choose a consistent settling time for each step when recording the capacitance value because we cannot wait until the weight completely settles.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct at least 10 trials of various thicknesses or until a change in capacitance can no longer be observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lab Question 3:</strong> Record your observation in the table below. Foil Capacitance = Measured Capacitance - Cable Capacitance, <script type="math/tex">C_{foil} = C_{total} - C_{cable}</script>.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The capacitor setup already has one sheet as a separation</p>
<p><strong>Lab Question 4 (Post-Lab):</strong> Using the area of the aluminum foils you measured and the separation distance of each step from your experiment into the relationship. Plot your results (Capacitance along the y-axis and separation distance along the x-axis) then draw the trend line. This can be done by hand or software. <strong>Hint:</strong> It's not a linear relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Lab Question 5 (Post-Lab):</strong> Calculate the coefficient for the trend line. Does it agree with the theoretical value of <script type="math/tex">\epsilon_0</script>? Explain why you think it is the same or not the same as the theoretical (other than human measurement error).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disconnect the DMM and return the aluminum foil once you are done.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-resistors-in-parallel-and-in-series">Part 2: Resistors in Parallel and in Series</h3>
