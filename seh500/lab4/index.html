<p>The APSR contains the following condition flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>N</strong>: Set to 1 when the result of the operation was negative, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Z</strong>: Set to 1 when the result of the operation was zero, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Set to 1 when the operation resulted in a carry, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="lab-preparation-question">Lab Preparation Question</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read over the lab and write a pseudocode for the post-lab exercise 4. Copy your pseudocode into Blackboard.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>Similar to the previous lab.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open MCUXpresso then start a new C/C++ project based on the Freedom board model that you have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the new project configuration, rename the project then leave all other settings as default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the project is created, rename the C-code file from ".c" to ".s". If the IDE is not allowing you to rename, delete the C-code file and create a new file of the same name but with the extension ".s".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the previous lab, we also explored the idea of using a label to reference address in memory used in the same manner as variables in high-level programming language, this time, we'll explore the use of string. Replace the code within the file with the following:</p>
<p><hr/><pre>

<li>
<p>Execute the code above, pay attention to what is happening in each register and record their value as per the code comment.

Submit your code and screenshot it as part of the post-lab.</p>

<p>In the previous code, we explored the idea of using string. In this code, we'll take a look at the use of an array. Replace the code within the file with the following:</p>

<li>
<p>Execute the code above, pay attention to what is happening in each register and record their value as per the code comment.

<p>Lastly, the code from the first example can also be written as follows using an array instead of a string. Also, a different comparison statement is used.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hint: put your string into memory using the .string directive</li>
<li>use R0 to hold the address for the string or character</li>
<li>use R1 as the counter for vowel</li>
<li>use R2 as the counter for non-vowel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the code above, at the end of execution, take a screenshot of your register bank, and your memory space showing the string then copy your code into Blackboard.</p>
